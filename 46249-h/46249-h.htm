<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pn p2">As may be inferred from the title-page, this book
has been written to mark the four hundredth
anniversary of Cambridge printing.</p>

<p>Of the original authorities used in its compilation
the most valuable has been the large collection of
documents relating to the Press which are preserved
in the Registry of the University. Access to this collection
has enabled me to glean some fresh information
concerning the careers of the university printers
and a series of accounts and vouchers from 1697 to
1742 has brought to light several new titles of books
printed at Cambridge during that period.</p>

<p>The making of this book, however, would not
have been feasible, in the limited time at my disposal,
had I not been free to use the work of the pioneers,
from Christopher Wordsworth and Henry Bradshaw
onwards, and the chief items of this work are recorded
in the short bibliography on page xiii.</p>

<p>In addition, my personal obligations are many:
Mr Francis Jenkinson, University Librarian, Mr
Charles Sayle, Mr A. T. Bartholomew, and many
other members of the Library staff have helped me
ungrudgingly, both in putting their own special
knowledge at my command and in guiding me to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
proper authorities; the Registrary (Dr J. N. Keynes)
and his staff have similarly given me ready access to
the documents in their charge; Mr J. B. Peace,
University Printer, provided me with the picture
which serves as frontispiece and with the revised
plan of the Press buildings; Mr G. J. Gray corrected
several of my statements in proof and gave
me the benefit of his own latest researches into the
career of John Siberch before they were published;
to many other friends (including my colleagues
in the several departments of the Press) I am indebted
for items of advice and help too many to be
enumerated.</p>

<p>I have also to thank the Master of Trinity College
for leave to reproduce the portrait of Bentley;
Messrs Bowes and Bowes for the blocks used on
pp. 6 and 14; and the Cambridge Antiquarian
Society for leave to make use of the papers on Cambridge
printing published in their <i>Proceedings</i>.</p>

<p class="p2 b1">Those who are familiar with the <i>Catalogue of
Cambridge Books</i> and the <i>Biographical Notes on
Cambridge Printers</i> will appreciate the measure of
my debt to the work of the late Robert Bowes.
When, in 1913, I sent him a copy of a magazine
article on the University Press, he wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq">I am by it carried back to my pleasant work of 25 to
30 years ago, and I am very glad in my 78th year to
see younger men interesting themselves in the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Time has robbed me of the pleasure of offering him
a work which owes much to his research.</p>

<p class="p2">Finally, it should be stated that the book attempts
to trace the general history of Cambridge printing
and not to enter into the finer points of bibliographical
technique. Similarly, only the briefest
sketch is given of the growth of Cambridge publishing
in the last 50 years; to do more would be
to cross the border-line between history and advertisement.
In Appendix <span class="smcap">II</span> I have carried on the
work begun by Mr Jenkinson for another 100
years. The list of books, though it may claim some
new titles, makes no pretension to finality; it is
rather a starting-point for the professed bibliographer.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">JOHN SIBERCH</p>

<p class="pn p2">Excursions into the realm of legend
have long served as the traditional method of
approach of the academic historian to his subject.
True, the story of the foundation of the university
of Cambridge by "one Cantaber, a Spaniard, about
370 years before Christ," or, as Fisher described
him in 1506, "Cantaber, a king of the East Saxons,
who had been educated at Athens," is now definitely
rejected as unhistorical; but it was only in 1914
that the name of Sigebert, King of the East Angles,
was removed from the list of royal benefactors<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1">University printing, like the university itself, has
its Apocrypha. Edmund Carter, writing in 1753,
includes a short section on <i>University Printers</i>:</p>

<p class="pbq">Printing had not been long used in <i>England</i> before
it was brought hither, but by whom it is difficult to
ascertain, tho' it may be supposed that <i>Caxton</i>, (who is
said to be the first that brought this curious art into
<i>England</i>, and was a <i>Cambridgeshire</i> Man, born at <i>Caxton</i>
in that County, from which he takes his Name) might
Erect a Press at <i>Cambridge</i>, as well as at <i>Westminster</i>,
under the care of one of his Servants; (for it is Conjectured,
he brought several from <i>Germany</i> with him).
The first Book we find an Account of, that was Printed
here, is a Piece of <i>Rhetoric</i>, by one <i>Gull. de Saona</i>, a
Minorite; Printed at <i>Cambridge</i> 1478; given by Archbp.
Parker to <i>Bennet</i> College Library. It is in Folio, the
Pages not Numbered, and without ketch Word, or
Signatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Alas for Carter's pious suppositions! Caxton, according
to his own testimony, was born in Kent and
Cambridge can claim only to be the place of compilation
of the <i>Rhetorica</i>; the phrase at the end of
the book, <i>Compilata in Universitate Cantabrigiae</i>, no
doubt led to the entry being made in the catalogue
in the form <i>Rhetorica nova, impressa Cantab, fo.</i>
1478, and the mistake persisted for two centuries.</p>

<p>Nor is Oxford without a controversial prologue
to the story of its printing. In the first Oxford book
the date appears in the colophon as <span class="smcap">mcccclxviii</span>
and for long it was sought to establish the claim
that Oxford printing preceded Caxton. But though
it has been contended that the ground for the
claim "has not yet entirely slipped away," it is
now generally accepted by bibliographers that the
printer omitted an <span class="smcap">x</span> from the date, which should
in fact be <span class="smcap">mcccclxxviii</span>.</p>

<p>"The oldest of all inter-university sports," said
Maitland, "was a lying match."</p>

<p class="p2">To return to Cambridge, we are on firmer, though
not very spacious, ground, when we come to the
name of John Siberch, the first Cambridge printer.
"True it is," says Thomas Fuller, "it was a great
while before Cambridge could find out the right
knack of printing, and therefore they preferred to
employ Londoners therein ... but one Sibert, University
Printer, improved that mystery to good perfection."</p>

<p>Of the life of Siberch, either at Cambridge or
elsewhere, we know little. He was the friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
several great humanists of the period, including
Erasmus; he was in Louvain, evidently, in 1518.
"I was surprised," writes Erasmus to John Caesarius
on 5 April of that year, "that John Siberch
came here without your letter."</p>

<p>The earliest appearance of his name on a title-page
is in 1520, when Richard Croke's <i>Introductiones
in rudimenta Graeca</i> was printed at Cologne
"expensis providi viri domini Ioannis Laer de Siborch."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
His full name, then (of which there are
many forms), is John Lair and his place of origin
Siegburg, a small town south-west of Cologne.</p>

<p>A discovery made by Mr Gordon Duff in the
Westminster Abbey Library in 1889 makes it almost
certain that Siberch was already in England
when Croke's book was printed; for in a copy of
a book bound by Siberch there was found, besides
two printed fragments and a letter from Petrus
Kaetz<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, a portion of the manuscript of the <i>Rudimenta
Graeca</i>. It seems clear, therefore, that Siberch
was in England when proofs and 'copy' of the work
were sent to him.</p>

<p>Richard Croke (afterwards the first Public Orator)
was at this time the enthusiastic leader of Greek
studies in Cambridge. He had earned fame as a
teacher at Cologne, Louvain, Leipzig, and Dresden
and, in succession to his friend Erasmus, was
appointed Reader in Greek to the university in
1519. His text-book could not be printed in
England, because there was as yet no Greek fount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
owned by an English printer; and it is quite probable,
as Mr Duff suggests, that John Siberch,
himself settled in Cambridge, had undertaken to
have Croke's work printed by a friend, possibly by
his old master, in Cologne. Possibly, too, Croke
may have previously met Siberch in Germany and,
with Erasmus, have been responsible for his coming
to Cambridge. This, of course, is conjectural, but
of the friendship between Erasmus and Siberch
there is no doubt, since, in a letter from Erasmus
to Dr Robert Aldrich, written on Christmas Day
1525, there is a message sent to "veteres sodales
Phaunum, Omfridum, Vachanum, Gerardum, et
Joannem Siburgum, bibliopolas."</p>

<p>From this it would naturally be inferred that
Siberch was still in Cambridge in 1525, but his name
does not appear in the Subsidy Roll of 1523-24 and
it is probable, therefore, that, unknown to Erasmus,
he left in the early part of 1523<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Siberch, then, probably lived in Cambridge from
1520 to 1523, a period during which the labours
of the first Cambridge humanists were beginning to
bear fruit. In 1497, the Lady Margaret, mother
of Henry VII, had appointed as her confessor John
Fisher, Master of Michaelhouse; and "to the wealth
and liberality of the one," in Mullinger's words,
"and the enlightened zeal and liberality of the other
the university is chiefly indebted for that new life
and prosperity which soon after began to be perceptible
in its history."</p>

<p class="b1">To the Lady Margaret were due the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of St John's and Christ's Colleges and the Professorship
and Preachership which bear her name; Fisher,
afterwards Bishop of Rochester and President of
Queens' College, was the first holder of the Divinity
chair and it was at his invitation that Erasmus, who
had taken a degree in divinity in Cambridge in
1506, came to live, in 1509 or 1510, in the turret-chamber
of Queens'. Though it is, perhaps, as the
first teacher of Greek (himself for the most part
self-taught and not, as Gibbon says, the importer of
Greek from Oxford) that Erasmus is most famous,
the result of his first lectures was disappointing:</p>

<p class="pbq">So far I have lectured on the grammar of Chrysoloras,
but to few hearers; perhaps I shall have a larger
audience when I begin the grammar of Theodorus,
perhaps I shall take up a theological lectureship.</p>

<p class="p1">This last hope was fulfilled in 1511, when Erasmus
was elected to the Lady Margaret's professorship
of divinity. His letters are full of petulant
complaints which may be taken as seriously as
those of Gray in later years. He sees no hope of
lecture-fees since his conscience will not let him
rob 'naked men,' and only by touting does it appear
possible to get pupils. The college beer is bad
and the townsmen boorish. So he retires to his
garret in Queens' and applies himself to his work
on the New Testament (<i>Novum Instrumentum</i>) and
his edition of St Jerome, both of which were to
play an important part in preparing the way for
the Reformation in England.</p>

<p class="b1">When weary of study, "for lacke of better exercise
he would take his horse and ryde about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Market Hill." But he has words of praise for the
Cambridge school of theology:</p>

<p class="pbq">In the University of Cambridge instead of sophistical
arguments, their theologians debate in a sober, sensible
manner and depart wiser and better men.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill024" id="ill024">i24</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">PART OF HAMOND'S PLAN OF CAMBRIDGE, 1592</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1 b1">It was to this Cambridge and, probably, to this
patron in Cambridge that John Siberch came. The
single reference to his place of residence and to his
position in the university occurs in the <i>Annals</i> of
Dr Caius:</p>

<p class="pbq">The space (he writes) between the gate of humility
and the gate of Virtue was formerly occupied by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
tenement called the King's Arms. This was once the
residence of John Sibert, alias Siberch, the University
Printer, who printed some books of John Lydgate and
others, and of Erasmus when he was residing at
Cambridge.</p>

<p class="p1">The "tenement called the King's Arms" explains
the use by Siberch of the royal arms as a printer's
device; but although <i>cum gratia et privilegio</i> appears
on the title-page of several books printed by
him, there is no official confirmation of his having
held the office of university printer<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>There are entries, however, in <i>Grace Books</i> and
in the <i>Audit Book</i> of the university which show that
in 1520 or 1521 the university advanced to him
the sum of twenty pounds:</p>

<p class="pbqn">Obligatur doctor Manfeld loco et vice magistri Norres
pro summa pecunie quam recepit Johannes bibliopola
ab universitate<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Probably, Mr Duff suggests, this sum of money&mdash;a
larger amount than a university stationer's fee&mdash;may
have been advanced with a view to helping
Siberch in the establishment of a press.</p>

<p>The debt is entered in the proctors' accounts
until the year 1524-25 and in <i>Grace Book B</i> it is
recorded under the date 1538-9 that John Law,
an alien priest, with Drs Ridley, Bulloke, Wakefield,
and Maundefelde owed £20 sterling to the
university, for which they had given a bond with
their signature and seals; reference is made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
this bond in the <i>Audit Book</i> under the dates 1546,
1549, and 1553. From the description of Siberch
as "presbiter alienigena" Mr Duff infers that Siberch
eventually forsook printing for the Church.</p>

<p>Such are the fragmentary references that have
survived concerning the career of the first Cambridge
printer.</p>

<p class="p2">Fortunately, however, eight complete specimens
of his book-printing have been preserved:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">i</span> The first Cambridge book (of which a page
is shown in facsimile) reflects the atmosphere of
the time. It is the <i>Oratio</i> delivered by Henry
Bullock, <span class="smcap">d.d.</span>, Fellow of Queens' College and afterwards
Vice-Chancellor, in honour of the visit of
Cardinal Wolsey to the university in the autumn
of 1520. The 'frequentissimus cetus' before whom
the oration was given included the imperial ambassadors
and several bishops.</p>

<p class="b1">The cardinal was lodged at Queens' College and
both town and university delighted to honour him,
as may be seen from the following items from the
proctors' accounts:</p>

<p class="pbq">To the Vicechancellor for expences in going round
the town with the mayor, to cleanse the streets against
the coming of the Cardinal, 2<i>s</i> 2<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class="pbq">Gifts to the Cardinal: for wine £3 6<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>; for carrying
the same to Queens coll. 12<i>d</i>; for 2 oxen, £3 7<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>; for
6 swans, 28<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>; for 6 great pikes, 33<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i>; for 6 shell
fish, 4<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i>; for a river fish called a breme, 6<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class="pbq">For repairing the streets on the Cardinal's coming,
13<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class="pbq">To 2 scholars who carried an altar on the coming of
the Cardinal, 4<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">The style of the oration is even more lavish than
the ceremonial preparations. "Scarcely from the obsequious
senates of Tiberius and Domitian did the
incense of flattery rise in denser volume or in coarser
fumes."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Bradshaw pointed out that the type used for the
printing of the <i>Oratio</i> appears to be quite new.
Many of the lines are wavy and irregular and there
are no woodcut initials or ornaments of any kind.
The second imprint, at the end of the book, runs:
<i>Impressa est haec oratiūcula Cantabrigiae, per me
Ioannem Siberch, post natum saluatorem, Millesimo
quingentesimo uicesimoprimo. Mense Februario.</i> A
second impression was printed a few months later
and issued with Siberch's third book.</p>

<p>Four libraries possess copies: the British Museum;
the Bodleian Library; Lambeth Palace; and Archbishop
Marsh's Library, St Patrick's, Dublin.
Cambridge unfortunately has no copy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ii</span> The second Cambridge book is the rarest of
all those printed by Siberch, only one copy (John
Selden's, bequeathed to the Bodleian Library in
1659) having been preserved.</p>

<p>It contains a letter addressed by a 'certain faithful
Christian' to 'all Christians' and a sermon of
Augustine <i>De miseria ac brevitate vitae</i>, of which
the full title may be read in the facsimile. In addition
to its uniqueness, the book has a further interest
in that the Greek motto on the title-page was printed
from the first genuine moveable Greek type used
in England. Woodcuts depicting scenes from the
Last Judgment and probably copied from a German
<i>Book of Hours</i> are also used on the title-page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">iii</span> The next book contains Lucian <i>περὶ δωδιψάδων</i>
translated by Henry Bullock, together with a reissue
of the <i>Oratio</i>. On the title-page there appears
for the first time the elaborate border with the
Arma Regia (the sign of the house in which Siberch
lived) at the foot. No other ornament is used, but
Greek type appears on the title-page, in the dedication,
and at the end of the book.</p>

<p>Four copies are known: two in the British
Museum, one in St John's College, Cambridge,
and one at Lambeth Palace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">iv</span> The fourth book, Archbishop Baldwin's <i>Sermo
de altaris sacramento</i> (1521), contains for the first
time a woodcut initial and the Arma Regia in
another form. The book is dedicated to Nicholas
West, Bishop of Ely, and in the dedication Siberch
claims to be the first printer to use Greek type in
England&mdash;"Ioannes Siberch primus utriusque linguae
in Anglia impressor."</p>

<p>Nine copies have survived: two in the Bodleian,
two in the University Library, Cambridge, one
in Trinity College, Cambridge, one in Magdalene
College, Cambridge, one in All Souls' College,
Oxford, one in Lincoln and one in Peterborough
Cathedral Library<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">v</span> The next book has many points of interest.
In the first place, it is by the printer's friend,
Erasmus, and its title gives a brief survey of the
manner of its composition: <i>Libellus de Conscribendis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
epistolis, Autore D. Erasmo, opus olim ab eodem cœptum,
sed prima manu, mox expoliri cœptum, sed intermissum,
Nunc primum prodit in lucem....</i> <span class="smcap">mdxxi</span>.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is the first book of any size undertaken
by Siberch. "Ignosces," he pleads, "candide
lector iam primum experienti mihi." Further, the
phrase <i>Cum gratia et privilegio</i> is now used on the
title-page for the first time; for this leave had
probably been obtained through Bishop Fisher,
in a dedication to whom the printer calls himself
'Cantabrigiensis typographus.'</p>

<p>Four copies are known: two in the British Museum,
one in St John's College, Cambridge, and
one in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; the last
has an additional interest in that it was bound by
Nicholas Speryng.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">vi</span> The sixth of the books printed by Siberch
is the commonest. It is a translation of Galen by
Thomas Linacre: <i>Caleni Pergamensis de Temperamentis,
et de inaequali intemperie libri tres Thoma
Linacro Anglo interprete.</i></p>

<p>It is described on the title-page, which has the
same border-device as <span class="smcap">iii</span>, as "opus non medicis
modo, sed et philosophis oppido q<i>uam</i> necessariu<i>m</i>";
it is dedicated to Pope Leo X and printed "cum
gratia et privilegio."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The existing copies of the book are in two states:
a copy in the first state was found by the late
Mr Robert Bowes in the library of Trinity College,
Dublin, containing only the <i>De Temperamentis</i>
and having on the last leaf but one a woodcut of
the Adoration of the Shepherds. The copy in the
Royal College of Physicians consists of this first
issue with the second essay added. The remaining
ten copies&mdash;University Library, Cambridge (2);
Bodleian Library (2); British Museum; Trinity
College, Cambridge; All Souls' College, Oxford;
Hunterian Museum, Glasgow; the Duke of Devonshire;
Mr Bowes&mdash;are in the second state, containing
both the <i>De Temperamentis</i> and the <i>De inaequali
intemperie</i>, the last two leaves of the former essay as
they appear in the first state being cancelled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">VII</span> The full title of the seventh Cambridge book
may be read in the facsimile here shown. It is a
Latin translation of the sermon delivered in London
by Fisher when Luther's books were publicly burned.</p>

<p>Siberch has now discarded his ornamental title-border,
but at the end of the book there appears a
new device, embodying his trade-mark and initials.
The book was printed late in 1521 and probably
issued early in the January of the next year.</p>

<p>Five copies are known: two in the Bodleian
Library; one in the University Library, Cambridge;
one in Magdalene College, Cambridge; and one in
the John Rylands Library, Manchester.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">VIII</span> The last of the eight books printed by
Siberch of which complete copies survive is <i>Papyrii
Gemini Eleatis Hermathena, seu De Eloquentiae Victoria</i>,
printed on the 8th December, 1522. There are
three different states of the title-page and six complete
copies are known: University Library, Cambridge;
British Museum; St John's College, Oxford;
Archbishop Marsh's Library, St Patrick's, Dublin;
Duke of Devonshire; Lincoln Cathedral Library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>To these eight books must be added the <i>De octo
partium orationis constructione libellus</i> of Lily and
Erasmus, two leaves of which were found in the
book bound by Siberch which Mr Duff discovered
at Westminster. This <i>libellus</i>, originally written by
William Lily and revised, at Colet's suggestion, by
Erasmus, was a popular school book of the period.</p>

<p class="b1">It was in the binding of the same book that the
letter from Petrus Kaetz, a Dutch printer, was also
found. This letter has many points of interest.
Kaetz sends Siberch "25 prognostications and 3
New Testaments small," as well as a parcel to be
delivered to Niclas [Speryng] and we may fittingly
conclude our notice of Siberch with the tribute of
a contemporary to his prospects as a printer:</p>

<p class="pbq">Know, Jan Siborch (writes Petrus Kaetz) that I have
received your letter as [well as specimens] of your type,
and it is very good; if you can otherwise ... and conduct
yourself well, then you will get enough to print.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">THE CHARTER&mdash;THOMAS THOMAS AND THE STATIONERS</p>

<p class="pn p2">Though it may not be clear to what extent
John Siberch was officially recognised as
printer to the university, it is evident that no
successor to him was immediately appointed. University
stationers and bookbinders, however, had
been for some time established in a privileged position.
As early as 1276 we find a reference to the
"writers, illuminators, and stationers, who serve
the scholars only," and in a note on this phrase
Fuller defines the <i>stationarii</i> as "publicly avouching
the sale of staple-books in standing shops
(whence they have their names) as opposite to such
circumforanean pedlers (ancestors to our modern
Mercuries and hawkers) which secretly vend prohibited
books."</p>

<p>In 1350 John Hardy, procurator of the Corpus
Christi Gild, is described as "stationarius of the University"
and we learn something of the stationers'
duties from the prohibition by Convocation in 1408
of the use in schools of "any book or tract compiled
by John Wiclif, or any one else in his time or since
or to be compiled thereafter" unless first examined
by the universities and afterwards approved by
the Archbishop. After the book had been finally
sanctioned, it was to be delivered "in the name and
by the authority of the University to the stationers
to be copied; and a faithful collation being made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the original should be deposited in the chest of
either University, there to remain for ever."</p>

<p class="b1">In his edition of <i>Grace Book A</i> (1454-88) Sir
Stanley Leathes summarises the position of the
<i>Stationaries</i> as follows:</p>


<p class="pbq">They were not students, nor were they exactly
servants or tradesmen. They were the official agents of
the University for the sale of pledges, and official valuers
of manuscripts and other valuables offered as security.
They seem to have received an occasional fee from the
Chest.... Like the servants and tradesmen dependent on
the University they were under the University jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="p1">Many of the stationers were binders as well and
the keeping of the university chest was included
in their duties; from the will of Petrus Breynans
(<i>c.</i> 1504) it also appears that they were provided
by the university with a distinctive gown<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1">At the beginning of the sixteenth century, we
find the stationers involved in one of the many disputes
between university and town, damaging alike
to study and to business. In 1502 both parties besought
the "amicable interference" of the Lady
Margaret, who counselled arbitration; the result
was an "indenture of covenant" executed by university
and town "pursuant to the award of Sir
Thomas Frowycke and the other arbitrators." One
clause in the indenture runs:</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="smcap">Item</span>, yt ys covenanted, accorded, and agreed bitwene
the said Parties, accordinge to the said Award, that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Bedells of the said Universitie, and all Mancipills,
Cooks, Butlers, and Launders of everye Colledge,
Hostell, and of other places ordeyned for Scolers,
Students, and places of religion in the said Universitie,
and all appotycares, Stacioners, Lymners, Schryveners,
Parchment-makers, Boke-bynders, Phisitions, Surgeons,
and Barbers in the sayd Universitie ... shall be reputed
and taken as Common Ministers and Servants of the
said Universitie, as longe as they shall use eny such
occupacion, and shall have and enjoye lyke privilege as
a Scolers Servant of the same Universitie shall have and
enjoye....<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="p1">In the list at the end of the award containing the
names of those privileged by the university, the
last entry is "Garreit Stacioner.", This "Garreit"
is the stationer and binder generally known as
Garrett Godfrey. When he first began business in
Cambridge is not known, but more than fifty specimens
of his binding, dating from 1499 to 1535,
have survived. We know also that he was churchwarden
of Great St Mary's in 1516 and again in
1521 and that he died in 1539<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Erasmus refers to him in 1516 as his "old host,
Garrett the bookseller" (which suggests that he
stayed in his house during his first visit to Cambridge),
and in 1525 sends a message, already
quoted, to Garrett and other booksellers.</p>

<p>Another stationer and bookbinder of the period
is Nicholas Spierinck (Speryng), whose name first
appears in <i>Grace Book B</i> under the date 1505-6.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Little is known of him as a stationer. He was a
Dutchman by birth and, like Garrett Godfrey,
was a friend of Erasmus and a churchwarden of
Great St Mary's. His will, of which he appointed
Thomas Wendy, the royal physician, as supervisor,
shows him to have been a man of property, since
he bequeathed to Nycholas Spyrynke, his "sonnes
sonne," the "howse of the Crosse Keyes"&mdash;a
brewery in Magdalene Street<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; of his work as a
binder nearly fifty examples remain.</p>

<p>The third of the Cambridge stationers of this
period whom we must consider is Segar Nicholson.
He also came from Holland, and, as Mr G. J. Gray
remarks, affords an early example of a member of
the university engaging in business, being a pensioner
of Gonville Hall from 1520 to 1523. His
career has more varied features than those of his
fellow-stationers.</p>

<p>In 1529 he was charged with holding Protestant
views and further with the unlawful possession of
Luther's books and other heretical works. Now
Luther's books had been publicly burnt in Cambridge
eight years before and the ceremony had,
as we have seen, been the occasion of a notable sermon
by Bishop Fisher. About this time, however,
there had grown up a small society of members
of the university who were sympathetic towards
Lutheran doctrine. They met in secret in the White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Horse inn, which stood where are now the back
buildings of the Bull Hotel&mdash;a place chosen so
that members might enter unobserved by the back
door and nicknamed 'Germany' by the orthodox<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
Among the heretics who frequented these meetings
was Segar Nicholson.</p>

<p>Foxe, in his <i>Acts and Monuments</i>, gives a sad account
of the treatment of Nicholson: "The handling
of this man," he says, "was too too cruel."
After his release from prison, Nicholson remained
a stationer till the age of 60, when he was ordained
deacon by the Bishop of London.</p>

<p>In the meantime the university had taken steps to
ensure the suppression of heretical books. In 1529 a
petition was presented to Cardinal Wolsey, begging:</p>

<p class="pbqn">that for the suppression of error, there should be three
booksellers allowed in Cambridge by the King, who
should be sworn not to bring in or sell any book which
had not first been approved of by the censor of books
in the University, that such booksellers should be men
of reputation and gravity, and foreigners, (so it should
be best for the prizing of books,) and that they might
have the privilege to buy books of foreign merchants<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">It was, no doubt, as a result of this petition that
five years later Cambridge printing was formally
established by royal charter on 20 July, 1534,
when Henry VIII by letters patent gave licence to
the Chancellor, masters, and scholars</p>

<p class="pbqn">to assign and elect from time to time, by writing under the
seal of the Chancellor of the University, three stationers
and printers, or sellers of books, residing within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
University, who might be either aliens or natives, and
hold either their own or hired houses. The stationers or
printers thus assigned, and every of them, were empowered
to print all manner of books approved of by the
Chancellor or his vicegerent and three doctors, and to sell
and expose to sale in the University or elsewhere within
the realm, as well such books as other books printed
within or without the realm, and approved of by the Chancellor
or his vicegerent and three doctors. If aliens, these
stationers or printers were empowered to reside in the
University, in order to attend to their business, and
were to be reputed and treated as the King's faithful
subjects and lieges, and to enjoy the same liberties,
customs, laws, and privileges; and to pay and contribute
to lot, scot, tax, tallage, and other customs and
impositions as the other subjects and lieges of the King.
Provided, that the said stationers or printers, being
aliens, paid all customs, subsidies, and other monies, for
their goods and merchandizes imported or exported, as
other aliens<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">This is the <i>Magna Carta</i> of Cambridge printing
and Fuller quotes with quiet pride the opinion of
Sir Edward Coke that "this University of Cambridge
hath power to print within the same 'omnes'
and 'omnimodos libros' which the University of
Oxford hath not."</p>

<p>We should now expect to see a steady continuance
of university printing. But, in spite of the
King's letters patent, the history of Cambridge
printing for nearly fifty years is a blank. It is true
that the university immediately availed itself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the privilege conferred upon it, and the "three
stationers and printers or sellers of books residing
within the university" who were appointed were
Nicholas Speryng, Garrett Godfrey, and Segar Nicholson,
whose careers have been sketched above.
That two of these were bookbinders and churchwardens,
that one owned a brewery, and that one
took holy orders we have evidence, but of printing
there is no trace. The strangest appointment is
that of Nicholson, since the aim of the university
in petitioning Wolsey for the control of printing
and bookselling was the suppression of those Lutheran
doctrines for which Nicholson had recently
been imprisoned.</p>

<p>But it is clear that, for a time at any rate, the
university, while showing no desire to encourage
the art of printing, was quick to establish its control
and censorship of books.</p>

<p>Some idea of a university bookseller's stock at
this time may be obtained from the will of Nicholas
Pilgrim<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, appointed in 1539 as successor to Garrett
Godfrey, from whom he inherited a "furryd gown
and iij presses with a cuttynge knife." Of the 717
books of which an inventory is given in Pilgrim's will
216 were bound and 501 unbound, the whole stock
being valued at £26 11<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>. Most of the books are
either editions of the classics or theological works, but
there are a few on medical and botanical subjects.</p>

<p>But like Richard Noke, appointed in 1540, and
Peter Sheres (1545-6) Pilgrim appears to have
been university printer only in name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">At the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, when all
unlicensed printing was prohibited, the powers of
the chancellors of the universities to license books
were duly recognised and in 1576, when John
Kingston was appointed as printer, the university
seems definitely to have contemplated the establishment
of a printing-press:</p>

<p class="pbq">On the 18th of July, Lord Burghley wrote from
Theobalds to Dr Goad Vicechancellor and the Heads,
with reference to their intention of bringing the exercise
of printing into the University, for which purpose they
had engaged one Kingston of London, whom they
purposed to protect with the University privilege to
print Psalters, Books of Common Prayer, and other
books in English, for which the Queen had already
granted special privileges to William Seres, Richard
Jugge, John Day, and others. His Lordship disapproved
of any attempts to prejudice the Queen's
grants, but thought they might employ an artificer for
printing matters pertaining to the schools &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="p1">In the light of this pronouncement it is easy to
understand why John Kingston, who was well-known
as a London stationer, printed no books in
Cambridge.</p>

<p>At last, in 1583, we come to the name of a
university printer who in fact printed books at
Cambridge: Thomas Thomas, Fellow of King's
College, was appointed University printer by grace
of 3 May, 1583, and in the same year began to print
a work by William Whitaker.</p>

<p>The Stationers' Company of London quickly
seized his press and declared that his attempt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
an infringement of their rights. In a letter to
Burghley, dated 1 June, 1583, the Bishop of
London wrote:</p>

<p class="pbqn">There was alsoe found one presse and furniture which
is saide to belonge to one Thomas a man (as I heare)
utterlie ignoraunte in printinge, and pretendinge that
he entendeth to be the printer for the universitie of
Cambridge.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The Vice-Chancellor and Heads, however, took
up the cause of their printer and in reply to a letter
from Burghley suggesting a conference with the
Stationers, wrote as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq">Our most humble duties to your honour remembred.</p>

<p class="pbq">Whereas we understand by your honours letters, that
certain of the company of the stationers in London have
sought to hinder the erecting of a print within the
university of Cambridg, and to impugne that antient
privilege, granted and confirmed by divers princes for
that purpose, to the great benefit of the university and
augmentation of learning: these are in most humble
manner to desire your honour, not so much in respect of
Mr Thomas, who hath already received great injury and
dammage at their hands, as in behalf of the university;
which findeth itself very much aggrieved with the
wrongful detaining of those goods, wherewithal, as we
are persuaded, in right and equity they ought not to
meddle, to continue our honorable patron, and to direct
your favourable warrants to the warden of the stationers,
that he may have his press delivered with speed; lest
that by their means, as he hath been disappointed of
Mr Whitakers book, so by their delays he be prevented
of other books made within the university, and now ready
for the press.</p>

<p class="pbq">As for the doubts which they caused, rather in respect
of their private gain and commodity, and to bring the
universities more antient privileges in this behalf than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
theirs under their jurisdiction at London, than for any
other good consideration, the deciding or peril whereof
also pertaineth not to them; we dare undertake, in the
behalf of Mr Thomas whom we know to be a very godly
and honest man, that the press shall not be abused,
either in publishing things prohibited, or otherwise inconvenient
for the church and state of this realm. And
this we promise the rather, for that his grace (whereof
we have sent a copy to your honour by himself) was
granted unto him upon condition that he should stand
bound from time to time to such articles as your honour
and the greatest part of the heads of colleges should ty
him unto.</p>

<p class="pbq">And for the conference, whereunto your honour
moveth us, if it shall be your honours pleasure, wee, as
desirous of peace and concord, (the premisses considered,)

<p class="pbq">From Cambridge, this 14th of June<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">This letter has been quoted in full partly because
it is the first of a long series of protests, partly
because it is a good example of the attitude consistently
adopted by the university in regard to
printing&mdash;a dutiful desire not to abuse their privilege
coupled with a dignified determination not
to be bullied by the Stationers.</p>

<p>As a result of the appeal contained in the letter,
the charter of 1534 was submitted to the Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the Rolls, who concurred in the opinion that it
was valid; and on 24 July, 1584, Thomas entered
into a recognizance in 500 marks before the Vice-Chancellor.</p>

<p class="b1">Books now began to issue from Thomas's press
and some of them quickly excited the odium
theologicum; when, for instance, a work by Walter
Travers in support of Presbyterianism was printed,
the greater part of the edition was confiscated.</p>

<p class="pbq">Ever sens I hard that they had a Printer in Cambridg
(wrote Archbishop Whitgift to Lord Burghley), I did
greatlie fear this and such like inconveniences wold
followe, nether do I thingk that yt wyll so stay, for

careful man and in all respectes greatlie to be commended,
yet yt may fawle owt hereafter, that some such

of the state, but whatsoever your Lordship shall thingk

I thingk yt verie convenient that the bokes
should be burned, beeing verie factius and full of untruthes:
and that (yf printing do styll there continew)
sufficient bonds with suerties shold be taken of the printer
not to print anie bokes, unlesse they be first allowed
by lawfull authoritie, for yf restrante be made here and
libertie graunted there, what good can be done....<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p class="p1">From this time forward, indeed, Cambridge
printing was for many years continually harassed by
two disturbing forces&mdash;theological suspicion and
by commercial jealousy. Thus, in 1585, when it
was discovered that London printers had printed
various books already printed by the universities, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
grace was passed forbidding Cambridge booksellers
to sell, and Cambridge students to buy, "any book
printed at London or elsewhere in England, which
had been or thereafter should be printed at
Cambridge or Oxford," always provided that the
university printers did not sell their books at a
higher price than that fixed by the Vice-Chancellor
and the others named in Thomas's articles.</p>

<p class="b1">In the next year the archbishop was again
growing anxious; in June, 1586, it was laid down
by a Star Chamber ordinance that no book was to
be printed without either his own or the Bishop of
London's approval, and a few months later Whitgift
wrote to his very loving friend the Vice-Chancellor:</p>

<p class="pbq">Salutem in Christo. I understand that there is now
in printing by the printer of that university, a certain
book, called Harmonia Confessionum Fidei, in English,
translated out of Latin; which book, for some special
causes, was here [i.e. in London] rejected, and not
allowed to be printed. These are therefore to require
you, that presently upon receipt hereof you cause the
said book to be stayed from printing any further; and
that nothing be don more therein, until you shall receive
further direction from me. And whereas there is order
taken of late by the lords of the council, that from henceforth
no book shall be imprinted either in London or in
either of the universities, unless the same shall be
allowed and authorized by the bishop of London or my
self, I do likewise require you to take special care, that
hereafter nothing be imprinted in that university of
Cambridge but what shall be authorised accordingly.
And so not doubting of your diligent circumspection
herein, I commit you to the tuition of Almighty God<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">As the <i>Harmony of Confessions</i> was duly published
in the same year, it would appear that it eventually
received the archbishop's approval; Macaulay's
view of Whitgift as a "narrow-minded, mean, and
tyrannical priest" would certainly have been confirmed
had he considered him in the light of his
censorship of Cambridge books.</p>

<p>Thomas Thomas's greatest achievement, perhaps,
was the compilation and printing of his <i>Latin
Dictionary</i> and when the London stationers began
to publish editions of this and other Cambridge
books, the university made another long protest
to the Chancellor, pointing out that it was a "verie
hard matter" either for the university to maintain
its privilege or for the printer to do any good by
his trade and begging of him "to become a meanes
to her highnes in this behalf ... to graunt a speciall
lycence to this our Universitie."</p>

<p>As the Star Chamber decree of 1586, to which
reference has been already made, ordained that
"none of the printers in Cambridge or Oxford for
the tyme being shal be suffered to have any moe
apprentices then one at one tyme at the most," it
is not to be expected that the output from Thomas's
press should be very large. But we know that
before his death at the early age of 35 he printed
at least twenty books<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Many of these reflect the
theological controversies of the time as, for
instance, <i>Two Treatises of the Lord His holie Supper
... written in the French tongue by Yues Rousseau and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Iohn de l'Espine ... translated into English</i> ("a very
elegant type, and as carefully printed," according to
Herbert) and <i>Antonii Sadeelis viri clarissimi vereque
Theologi de Rebus Grauissimis controuersis Disputationes
accuratae Theologice et scholastice Tractatae</i>,
both printed in 1584. In the inventory of his will
it is interesting to note that, with one exception,
Thomas had stock, at the time of his death, of all
books printed by himself; he left, too, 39 Reames
of pott paper in the garret (£8) and 8 skynnes of
parchment ruled with read ynck (2<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>). His
serviceable type, consisting of long primer, pica,
and brevier (Roman and Italique), together with
some "greeke letter," amounted to 1445 lb and
was valued at 3<i>d</i> a lb. In his "necessaries for
pryntinge" are included "one presse with the
furneture" (66<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>), "iiij<sup>or</sup> payer of chases"
(13<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i>), "ij great stooles" (12<i>d</i>), "iiij<sup>or</sup> gallies"
(16<i>d</i>) and "the wasshing troufhe" (12<i>d</i>)<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p class="p2 b1">But it is on his <i>Latin Dictionary</i> that the fame
of Thomas Thomas chiefly rests. "In hoc opere"
he writes on the title-page, "quid sit praestitum ad
superiores <i>λεξικογραφοὺς</i> adjectum, docebit epistola
ad Lectorem" and in the <i>epistola</i> we learn how the
work came into being:</p>

<p class="pbq">Precibus enim Ludimagistrorum ac studiosorum
victus, quibus accessit etiam amicorum frequens postulatio,
ex immenso Lexicorum pelago nostrum contraxi,
quod trivialibus saltem ludis inserviret.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The last words of this same address to the reader
show that, like Johnson's, the dictionary was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
compiled "in the soft obscurities of retirement, or
under the shelter of academick bowers":</p>

<p class="pbq">Cantebrigiae ex nostris aedibus, carptim inter operarum
susurros, Tertio Nonas Septembres, Anno salutis
per Christum Dominum partae, 1587.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">In the eleventh edition, printed by Thomas's
successor in 1619, the following tribute is paid to
him in the dedication to Francis Bacon:</p>

<p class="pbq">He was about 30 years ago a famous Printer among
your Cantabrigians; yes something more than a Printer
such as we now are, who understand the Latin that we
print no more than Bellerophon the letters he carried,
and who sell in our shops nothing of our own except the
paper <i>black with the press's sweat</i>. But he, a companion
of the Stephenses and of the other, very few, printers of
the true kind and best omen, was of opinion that it was
men of learning, thoroughly imbued with academic
studies, who should give themselves to cultivating and
rightly applying that illustrious benefit sent down from
heaven and given to aid mankind and perpetuate the
arts. Accordingly what more fit than that when he had
wrought what was worthy of type, he should himself,
needing aid of none, act as midwife to his own progeny.</p>

<p class="p1">Thomas's printing-office was in the Regent Walk,
immediately opposite the west door of Great St
Mary's; his death is said to have been hastened by
the labours of the dictionary, and in 1588 he was
buried in the churchyard of Great St Mary's.</p>

<h2 class="p4">III</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">FROM JOHN LEGATE TO ROGER DANIEL</p>

<p class="pn p2">No time was lost, after the death of Thomas
Thomas, in appointing a successor, for John
Legate was elected by grace of 2 November, 1588,
"as he is reported to be skilful in the art of printing
books"; and almost immediately the new printer
became involved in disputes with the Stationers'
Company.</p>

<p>The corporate existence of the London Stationers
dates back to 1407, but their first charter was
granted by Mary in 1557. The result of this charter
of incorporation was that no one, except the holders
of special licences or privileges, could print books
for sale; by the rules of the company a member who
wished to print a book and claim the ownership of
it was required to enter its name in the register of
the company. Thus he obtained the only kind of
'copyright' which then existed.</p>

<p>On her accession, Elizabeth confirmed the Stationers'
charter, but shortly afterwards, <i>Injunctions</i>
were issued which required all books to be licensed
either by the Queen herself, or six members of the
Privy Council, or the Archbishops, or the Bishop
of London, or the Chancellors of the Universities,
or the bishop of the diocese.</p>

<p>It was, however, found to be impossible to enforce
such a stringent regulation and in 1577 we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
find a number of printing licences issued to private
persons. Thus John Jugge became Her Majesty's
printer of Bibles; to Richard Tothill was given the
"printinge of all kindes <i>Lawe bookes</i>"; to John Day
the monopoly of the <i>ABC</i> and <i>Catechism</i>; to
Thomas Marshe "Latin books used in the grammar
schools"; to William Seres "salters, primers and
prayer books."</p>

<p>As we have already seen, it was these grants
which, in spite of the confirmation of the university's
licence at the beginning of the reign,
effectually stood in the way of the establishment of
a press at Cambridge by John Kingston.</p>

<p>The London Stationers also took alarm and
petitioned the Queen. At first they were merely
rebuked for daring to question the royal prerogative
but, "approaching her Majesty a second time more
humbly than before," the Company was granted
a monopoly of both printing and selling psalters,
primers, almanacks, <i>ABC</i>'s, the little Catechism,
and Nowell's English and Latin Catechism.</p>

<p>Of all such monopolies the university, by the
power given to it in the charter of 1534 to print
<i>omnimodos libros</i>, had been made nominally independent,
and it was therefore inevitable that
disputes should arise; furthermore, there being as
yet no regularised law of copyright, such disputes
were likely to be most violent when there was
competition in the sale, as well as in the printing,
of a text-book.</p>

<p>Thus when John Legate, himself a freeman of the
Stationers' Company, printed an edition of Terence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for the use of scholars in 1589 and sent copies to be
sold in London, the Stationers quickly confiscated
them; on their part, the Stationers were at the
same time contemplating another pirated edition of
Thomas's <i>Dictionary</i>. The university made its usual,
dignified complaint to Lord Burghley.</p>

<p class="b1">Again, in 1591, Legate, who had in that year
produced the first English bible printed at Cambridge,
was accused of infringing the monopoly of
Barker and Day, the privileged printers. In their
reply to the charge, the Vice-Chancellor and Heads
of Houses whilst hinting that the doctrine "that the
prince by virtue of prerogative may, by a later
grant, either take away or abridge a former" is not
only "against the rule of natural equity" but also
"dangerous to all degrees, opening a way to the
overthrow of all patents and privileges," base their
appeal upon an <i>ad misericordiam</i>, with a final reminder
of the charter and its ratification; in particular,
they emphasise the plight of the printer
himself:</p>

<p class="pbq">The suit which they [the Stationers] have made unto
your lordship for the stay of our printer until the next
term, is so prejudicial to the poor man, as if they should
prevail therein, it could not but tend to his utter undoing;
especially Sturbridge-fair now drawing near;
being the chiefest time wherein he hopeth to reap
greatest fruit of this his travail<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Similarly, in 1596, Legate was charged&mdash;this
time by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners&mdash;with
infringing the right of the Queen's patentees by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
printing the Grammar and Accidence. The Vice-Chancellor
was required to collect all copies printed
at Cambridge and to take bond with surety in £100
of each of the university printers not to print
either book without leave. Some months later the
Vice-Chancellor reported to the Archbishop that
search had been made "by honest men sworn who
said upon their oath that there were no such books
printed here." This is the last we hear of such
disputes for some time, but it is clear that the
university jealously guarded its right of selling, as
well as of printing, books, since in 1592 J. Tidder,
of London, was sued in the Vice-Chancellor's Court
for selling books in the Cambridge market<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1">In the later part of his career Legate became
intimately associated with the London stationers.
An entry in the Stationers' Registers under the
date 1 August, 1597, shows that his official position
was then recognised:</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="smcap">Whereas</span> John legat hathe printed at Cambridge by
Aucthoritie of the vniuersitie there a booke called the
<i>Reformed Catholike</i>: This seid booke is here Registred
for his copie so that none of this Company shall prynt
yt from hym. <span class="smcap">Provided</span> that this entrance shalbe voyd
yf the seid booke be not Aucthorised by the seid
vniuersitie as he saieth it is, vj<sup>d</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Legate married the daughter of Christopher
Barker and became Master of the Stationers'
Company in 1604. He left Cambridge in 1609
and after that date all books printed by him have
<i>London</i> on the title-page; the title, however, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
"printer to the university" he retained until his
death in 1620.</p>

<p>In Cambridge he rented a shop for <i>5s</i> per
annum in St Mary's parish from 1591 to 1609,
probably the same house in the Regent Walk as
that in which Thomas had lived, and was the first
printer to use the device <i>Alma Mater Cantabrigia</i>
with the motto <i>Hinc Lucem et Pocula Sacra</i> surrounding
it.</p>

<p>In partnership with Legate was John Porter.
There is no record of his appointment, but it is
evident that he was one of the university stationers
appointed under the charter. In 1593 we find
him associated with Legate in the prosecution of
John Tidder and several books of 1595 and other
dates are described as printed for him and John
Legate<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p class="p2 b1">In the Register of the Stationers' Company it is
recorded under the date 26 April, 1589:</p>

<p class="pbq">Cantrell Legge sonne of Edwarde Legge of Burcham
in the Countie of Norffolk Yoman, hathe put himself
apprentize to John Legat Citizen and Stacioner of
London for Eighte yeres from midsomer nexte<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">This Cantrell Legge was appointed one of the
university printers in 1606 and appears to have
issued many books in co-operation with the Stationers.
Later, however, difficulties again arose,
for in 1620 Legge was prosecuted by the company
for printing Lily's <i>Grammar</i>. The university vehemently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
protested to the Archbishop of Canterbury:</p>

<p class="pbq">Ferunt enim Londinenses Bibliopolas suum potius
emolumentum quam publicum spectantes, (quae res et
naturae legibus et hominum summe contraria est) monopoliis
quibusdam inhiare, ex quo timemus librorum
precia auctum iri, et privilegia nostra imminutum. Nos
igitur hoc metu affecti, ubi sanguis solet in re dubia ad
cor festinare, ita ad Te confugimus primariam partem
ecclesiastici corporis....</p>

<p class="p1 b1">and to Lord Chancellor Bacon:</p>

<p class="pbq">Ecquid permittis Domine?... Aspicis multitudinem
Librorum indies gliscentem, praesertim in Theologia,
cujus Libri si alii aliis (tanquam montes olim) imponerentur,
veri simile est, eos illuc quo cognitio ipsa
pertingit ascensuros. Quod si et numerus Scriptorum
intumescat, et pretium, quae abyssus crumenae tantos
sumptus aequabit? Jam vero miserum est, pecuniam
retardare illam, cui naturae spiritum dederit, feracem
gloriae, et coeleste ingenium quasi ad metella damnari.
Qui augent precia Librorum, prosunt vendentibus libros
non ementibus, hoc est cessatoribus non studiosis....<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Evidently the high prices charged by the Stationers
for books of which they held, or claimed to
hold, a monopoly were the source of bitter complaints
amongst teachers and students and the university
authorities set up a spirited opposition: "As
to ye poore printer," wrote Dr Gooch, Master of
Magdalene, to the Registrary (James Tabor): "there
is no waye but one, the universitie must stand upon
our Charter."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Tabor prepared a list of comparative prices showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that while the Stationers charged 4<i>d</i> a sheet for
Aesop's <i>Fables</i> the Cambridge printer sold them at
3<i>d</i>, that Ovid's <i>Epistles</i> cost 8<i>d</i> a sheet in London
and only 5<i>d</i> in Cambridge and so on<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the university seized the opportunity
offered by the King passing through Royston on
16 December, 1621, to bring the matter before the
supreme tribunal.</p>

<p>Dr Mawe, the Vice-Chancellor, was in London
at the time but, leaving his own business unfinished,
he hastened back and with Dr Warde, Dr Beale, the
Registrary, and Legge himself "went to Royston to
deliver a Letter and Petition to the King in ye behalf
of ye Universitye."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The King, having heard
the complaint against the Stationers' monopoly of
"ye cheife vendible books in the land," against their
high prices, their bad paper, and their inaccurate
printing, referred the matter to a committee composed
of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop
of Lincoln, Lord Maundeville, and the Lord Chief
Justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This committee, however, by reason of "several
and distracted imployments" had no time to discuss
the case and, acting on its recommendation, the King
himself directed that the university printer might
continue to sell his <i>Grammars</i> without the let or disturbance
of any person whomsoever.</p>

<p>But a trade dispute of long standing was not
settled, even in the seventeenth century, by a royal
injunction. The leading London booksellers combined
to keep the Cambridge edition of Lily's
<i>Grammar</i> ("though sold at the cheapest price")
out of the market and by intimidation compelled
other booksellers to follow their lead; the university
retaliated by a grace of the Senate which forbade
Cambridge booksellers to deal with the hostile
London group and ordered all members of the
university "who should desire any author, of
whatsoever language, or any composition of his
own, to be printed, wheresoever he should live in
England," to offer his work to the university
printer in the first instance and further, if he
should become a schoolmaster, "to use the books
printed in the university which may be for the
profit of his boys, and not suffer others than those
printed in the university in his school, whilst the
same books should be printed and sold here at a
moderate and fair price by the royal authority."
That the university authorities became impatient
of the continual disputes both between Cambridge
printers themselves and between the Cambridge
printers and the London stationers is shown by the
appointment in 1622 of a syndicate to examine
"what charters orders and decrees have heretofore
been granted and made concerning the government
of the University presses and the printers and
the stationers and how they have been observed
and when broken and by whom."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The next award of the Privy Council, made on
29 November, 1623, embodied a compromise: the
Cambridge printers were authorised to comprint
with the Stationers all books save bibles, books of
common prayer, grammars, psalters, primers or books
of common law; they were to have one press only
and to print only those almanacks of which the first
copy was brought to them. A later order similarly
forbade the printing of prayer-books, "and as to
books whereof the first copy was brought to the
University printer, he was to have the sole printing,
as the London printers were to have of all books
whereof the first copy was brought to them."</p>

<p>From the rather wearisome history of this constantly
recurring dispute<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, two main facts seem to
emerge: the difficulty, in the absence of any fixed
law, of establishing copyright in a printed book
and the incompatibility of the wide powers conferred
on the university by the charter of 1534
with the Stationers' claim to a trade monopoly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">A study of the list of books printed between
1588 and 1625 will show that there was by this
time a slow, but steady, output of Cambridge
books. Prominent among them are the works of
that voluminous theologian, William Perkins, "the
Learned, pious, and painfull preacher of God's
word in St Andrewes in Cambridge" whose virtues
are celebrated by Fuller in the second book of <i>The
Holy State</i> (1642):</p>

<p class="pbq">His Sermons were not so plain but that the piously
learned did admire them, nor so learned but that the
plain did understand them.... He would pronounce the
word <i>Damne</i> with such an emphasis as left a doleful Echo
in his auditours ears a good while after. And when
Catechist of Christ-Colledge, in expounding the Commandments,
applied them so home, able almost to make
his hearers hearts fall down, and hairs to stand upright.</p>

<p class="p1">Perkins's works, dealing with such subjects as
<i>A Direction for the government of the Tongue</i>, <i>Salve
for a Sicke man</i>, <i>A Reformed Catholike</i>, and <i>The
Damned art of witchcraft</i>, and other theological
matters were collected into three folio volumes.</p>

<p>Thomas's <i>Latin Dictionary</i> was regularly reprinted,
reaching its tenth edition in 1610.</p>

<p>In 1603 there appeared <i>Threnothriambeuticon.
Academiae Cantabrigiensis ob damnum lucrosum, &amp;
infoelicitatem foelicissimam, luctuosus triumphus</i>, a
symposium of classical expressions of grief and joy
on the death of Elizabeth and the accession of
James I. Amongst the contributors were Phineas
Fletcher, Matthew Wren (afterwards Bishop of
Ely) and Dr Stephen Perse. Similar anthologies
of loyalty were published in celebration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
return of the Prince of Wales from Spain in 1623
and of his accession in 1625, and the practice was
continued throughout several reigns; a poem in
Latin hexameters (<i>In homines nefarios</i>) was also
provoked by the Gunpowder Plot. Two works of
James I were printed at the Press: <i>A Princes
Looking Glasse</i>, translated by W. Willymot (1603),
and <i>A Remonstrance for the Right of Kings</i> (1616
and 1619).</p>

<p class="b1">In 1610 there appeared the first work of Giles
Fletcher: <i>Christs Victorie and Triumph in Heaven
and Earth over and after death</i>, with a dedicatory
epistle to Nevile, the Master of Trinity:</p>

<p class="pbq">My opinion of this Island hath always been, that it
is the very face, and beauty of all Europe, in which both
true Religion is faithfully professed without superstition,
and (if on earth) true Learning sweetly flourishes without
ostentation: and what are the two eyes of this Land, but
the two Universities ... and truly I should forget myself,
if I should not call Cambridge the right eye.</p>

<p class="p1">In the same year there was printed for David
Owen, Fellow of Clare Hall, a controversial work
entitled <i>Herod and Pilate reconciled</i>. This led
Ralph Brownrigg (Fellow of Pembroke and afterwards
Bishop of Exeter) to invite Owen to his
rooms and to catechise him as to whether a king
breaking fundamental laws might be opposed. The
Vice-Chancellor thereupon summoned Brownrigg
to Trinity and after reminding him that Owen's
book had received official sanction to be printed,
suspended him from his degrees both for questioning
the university's privilege of printing and for propounding
seditious questions to Owen. Brownrigg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
recanted shortly afterwards and was restored by
the Vice-Chancellor, but the incident is interesting,
as showing the jealousy with which the privilege
of university printing was guarded and the limitations
imposed upon free speech even in college
rooms.</p>

<p>More serious trouble arose out of the publication
of a controversial work entitled <i>The Interpreter</i>
by John Cowell, Master of Trinity Hall. It was
suppressed by royal proclamation in 1610 and all
copies were ordered to be brought to the Chancellor
or Vice-Chancellor.</p>

<p>In 1623 Legge printed the first Cambridge book
which contained music&mdash;<i>The Whole Booke of Psalmes
... with apt notes to sing them</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the methods and costs of printing at this
time an interesting light is thrown by a document
of 1622 entitled <i>A direction to value most Bookes by
the charges of the Printer and Stationer as paper
was sould</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>The finest paper is reckoned at 5<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>, the lowest
quality at 3<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i> the ream; the former was used for
Bibles and Psalms in 8vo, for which the charge of
printing and paper is estimated at 13<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i> the ream,
the cheaper kind for grammars and school books,
printed for 8<i>s</i> the ream ("though the Londiner
giveth but 6<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i> at the most").</p>

<p class="b1">Evidently the writer is seeking to show that the
London Stationers were making exorbitant profits
on the sheets they bought from the Cambridge
printers, for he goes on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">If upon the first sight of any booke printed in England
you desire to knowe the chardge of the printer for paper
and printinge, Looke in the Alphabett what letter the
last sheete beareth, then reckon to that ... for example
take Legg's Grammer, the letter is O, so there are 14
sheetes in that booke ... if you will allow them 10<i>s</i> a
Reame, that is ¼<i>d</i> the sheete, it is 3½<i>d</i> for the Grammer
in Quires, and now the Stationers sell them for 8<i>d</i> in
Quires and so they get 4½<i>d</i> in every eight pence.</p>

<p class="p1">Similarly the Stationers are accused of buying
the Psalms at 12<i>s</i>, and selling them at a price
equivalent to £1 17<i>s</i> the ream.</p>

<p>Cantrell Legge died in 1625<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Thomas Brooke,
Esquire Bedell, had been appointed some time
before 1608; he evidently printed in partnership
with Legge, as is shown by the title-page of Perkins's
<i>Exposition of the Sermon in the Mount</i> (1608) and
the document containing his resignation may be assigned
to the years between 1621 and 1625<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p>Leonard Greene, admitted a member of the
Stationers' Company in 1606, had been appointed
by grace of 31 October, 1622. He had a shop "at
the south side of the steple" of Great St Mary's
and was in partnership with Thomas and John
Buck; thus on the title-page of Pietro Sarpi's <i>History
of Italy under Paul</i>, translated into Latin by
W. Bedell (1626), the three names appear together.</p>

<p>Thomas Buck of Jesus, afterwards Fellow of
St Catharine's College and Esquire Bedell, was one
of the most distinguished Cambridge printers of the
seventeenth century. He had many partners, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
most of whom he quarrelled, and he produced
many fine books.</p>

<p>Charles I had come to the throne a few months
before Buck's appointment and on the occasion of
the new king's proclamation loyal Cambridge had
spent 9<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i> for "a gallon of sacke and 2 gallons of
Clarrett," 5<i>s</i> "for sugercakes" and 6<i>s</i> "for a bone
fier that night." Immediately after his accession
Charles issued a`proclamation "to inhibit the sale
of Latin books reprinted beyond the seas, having
been first printed in Oxford or Cambridge"&mdash;a
further illustration of the evils which arose out of
the laxity of copyright. But a document of much
greater importance in the history of Cambridge
printing was the charter granted to the university
in 1628: the King, in an attempt to settle the controversy
once and for all, ratified the grant made
by Henry VIII and declared that the university
stationers and printers might print and sell any
books which he or his two predecessors had licensed
any person or body of persons to sell; and, further,
that they might print and sell all books which had
been, or should be, allowed by the Chancellor,
"any letters patent, or any prohibition, restraint,
clause, or article, in any letters patent whatsoever,
notwithstanding."</p>

<p>In spite of this, we find an order of the Privy
Council in 1629 recognising the right of the
university to print bibles which should contain
the liturgy and the psalms, but not to print "these
alone without the bibles"; further, the university's
output of Lily's <i>Grammar</i> was limited to 3000 copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a year and a few years later the university appears
to have surrendered its right to print bibles, almanacks,
and Lily's <i>Grammar</i> for three years in lieu
of an annual payment from the London Stationers.</p>

<p class="b1">Meanwhile, Thomas Buck was vigorously extending
the activities of the Cambridge Press. His
first partner was Leonard Greene with whom in
1625 he bought the whole of Cantrell Legge's
printing-house from Legge's executrix<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; Greene's
complaints throw an interesting light on the difficulties
of co-operation between the Cambridge
scholar and the London man of business:</p>

<p class="pbq">That whereas L. Gr. beinge acquainted with the
matter of bookes and printinge by reason of his trade
therein for the space of thirtie yeeres almost, and
Mr Bucke being unexperienced, haveing lead a students
life, the said L. Gr. did hide nothing and conceale
nothing from the said Mr Bucke nor spare any paines
(although to the hindrance of his owne busines divers
from this) whereby the common benefite of the presse
might be furthered.</p>

<p class="pbq">That for divers copies the sole printinge whereof the
said L. Gr. might have had for his owne profite as he is
of the Company of Stationers of London, he hath ever
brought to this presse, notwithstandinge he hath but a
third part therein (and some of them and the best were
his before ever Mr Bucke came into the place), and
besides the charge of printinge at Cambridge is deerer
then at London.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">One of Greene's further complaints was that
Buck deserted the old printing-house in Regent
Walk ("which Thomas and Legatt had successivelie
all their time hired") and took instead a lease of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"the Angell," an inn which faced Market Hill on
the site now occupied by Messrs Macintosh<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p class="pbq">For all the time (Greene complained) since the presse
went to the Angell his [Thomas Buck's] behaviour was
to me not as to a Partner but as to a stranger or servant;
when ever we came to debate any matter betweene us
if I did not yeeld to him he would put me off in this
manner that I came to trouble him; whereas the business
concerned me as well as himselfe....</p>

<p class="pbq">Now last of all he hired a house soe farre from me as
possiblie I could not be there in partnership with him....
Beinge thus wearied with uncertainties and havinge noe
bonds either for partinge or continueinge whereby I
might either get or save, I thought it the safer of two
evills to chuse the lesse, although with great losse for
the time past and hope for time to come, besides the
partinge with the deerest favour of the Universitie
priviledge, which I never would have doone till my
death, had it not beene for the danger I was in for debt.</p>

<p class="p1">Finally, Greene claims "a part in the profite of
the presse for the time accordinge to rate knowne
by workmen for 1275 Remes printed"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> as well as
his "third part in the Bishops booke, in Almanacks,
schoole bookes etc."</p>

<p>How far Greene was able to substantiate his
claim before the university is not recorded; he
died in October, 1630.</p>

<p class="b1">Thomas Buck's other partner was his brother
John, appointed in 1625. Though he, like all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Thomas's colleagues, afterwards found cause of
dispute with him, it is interesting to note how, on
Leonard Greene's death, the brothers quickly co-operated
to secure the vacant office of printer for
another member of the family. The following letter<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
was written by John to Thomas on 24 October,
1630:</p>

<p class="pbq">Brother Thomas,</p>

<p class="pbq2">I pray returne with all speede to Cambridge.
Leonard Greene is dead, there's a patent void and within
14 dayes a third man must be chosen. I pray be not
dissartoned att it. For I have the Vice-Chancellor and
ten Heads and Presidents sure to us, and they have all
(I humbly thank you) promised me faithfully to prick
whomsoever you and I shall desire; I think my brother
ffrancis would be a fitt man to commend unto you; but
if you know it to bring in Mr Barker<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> would prove more
advantagious to us, I desire you to intreat him to come
downe with you, or any other in London whom you best
like of. This in hast. I remitt you to God and rest,</p>

<p class="pn30 reduct">Your very loving brother,</p>
<p class="pn60 reduct">John Buck.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Francis Buck was accordingly elected in 1630,
but seems to have taken no active share in the
printing business. When he resigned two years
later he claimed nothing for his patent and afterwards
declared:</p>

<p class="pbq">I only did beare the name of it to do them [Thomas
and John] a pleasure or benefitt; and likewise when I
did give it over to Mr Daniel I thought it would be a
benefitt to my brothers.</p>

<p class="p1">From this it seems clear that the appointment of
Roger Daniel as printer on 24 July, 1632 (three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
days after the resignation of Francis) was in accordance
with the plans of the brothers Buck<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>Another family arrangement, made earlier (31
May) in the same year, was one by which John
Buck demised the "benefitt of his patent of Printer
to the Universitie for the terme of vii yeares to
Thomas Buck, he paieing yearely the summe of
lvi<sup>li</sup> for the same and John Buck should exercise
his brother Thomas Buck's place of Bedell during
the said terme."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>With two bedellships and two printer's patents
in the family, Thomas evidently felt it better that
each brother should specialise in one department.</p>

<p>By his first agreement with Thomas Buck Daniel
promised to take</p>

<p class="pbqn">that Capitall messuage and tenement called the Augustine
Fryers wherein the said Thomas Buck now dwelleth together
with the printing house and all other houses
yards orchards closes wayes and all other easements
and commodities thereunto belonging. Except ... all that
chamber over the parlor commonly called the great
chamber together with the green chamber and cole
house thereunto adjoyning, as also two studies in the
correcting roome<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">This paragraph has a special interest in that it
describes the only one of the early printing-houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of which a pictorial record has been preserved.
The sketch here shewn is described by Cole as</p>

<p class="pbq">The West Prospect of what remains of the Priory of
St Austin in Cambridge, late the Dwelling House of
Mr Buck, and now the House belonging to the Curator
of the Botanic Garden. It was taken Jan. 19, 1770 by
Mr Tyson, Fellow of Benet College, from a Chamber
Window in that College, and just opposite to it. It is
drawn rather too short at the North end<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">The building was "just behind the East End of
St Benedict's Church and Corpus Christi College."</p>

<p class="b1">The inventory of the goods, of which Daniel was
to enjoy the free use, shows something of a seventeenth
century printer's stock-in-trade:</p>

<p class="pbq">Six printing presses, five copper plates, six bankes,
seven great stones, one muller, thirteen frames to set
cases on, all the poles for drying of bookes ... twelve
candlesticks for the presses, two frames to put cases in,
six and fifty paire and an halfe of cases for letters made
of mettle and one case for wooden letters, five and
twenty chases, twenty gallies, fifty paper and letter
bords, two tressell tables, four tables with drawers, two
troughs of lead and all the shelves and formes of deal
in the wool-house.</p>

<p class="p1">Daniel, on his part, agreed to pay an annual rent
of £190, to employ but three presses at a time, and
to use paper, ink, and letter "very commendable
and good so as the University may receive credit
and honour thereby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Like others, Daniel quickly found cause of complaint
against Thomas Buck. By the second deed
of partnership (1633) he was to receive one-third
of the profits, but in the next year protested that
Buck had insisted upon impossible conditions.</p>

<p class="b1">One of the features of Thomas Buck's career is his
close association with the London Stationers. Thus
in 1631 he entered into a contract with Edmund
Weaver to supply him with certain quantities of
books and almanacks for three years. By this
agreement Buck tied himself to print only for the
Stationers for this period, Weaver "sending paper
and paieing London price for the printinge," and
Buck being allowed to retain as many books and
almanacks as were required for sale in Cambridge.
The following summary shows the type of school
book most in demand and the number of books
supplied during the three years:</p>

<p class="p1">For Buck's business the arrangement was no
doubt a profitable one, but the Cambridge stationers
complained that, when they wanted school
books printed at the Press, either they could not
have them "because alreadie they were sent up to
London," or else they were obliged to pay the
high prices demanded by the London Stationers<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of the agreement with Weaver,
Daniel had evidently been acting for Buck in London,
but after three years' experience of partnership
with Buck he had begun to look at the matter
in a new light.</p>

<p class="b1">In 1635 he presented a petition to the Vice-Chancellor
in which Buck is attacked as a grasping
monopolist:</p>

<p class="pbq">At y<sup>e</sup> petitioner's first entrance to be printer to the
University, Mr Thomas Buck tyed him by covenants
and bonds of a thousand pounds to performe and keep
such Covenants as he had formerly made with the Stationers
of London ... it will appeare that the University
Presse is servant to the said Stationers and the University
and commonwealth deprived of that benefit which is
intended by our Priviledge....</p>

<p class="pbq">He perceiving that I was able to goe on with y<sup>e</sup>
printing Psalmes without his helpe, and that I was
forward and willing to print other bookes which would
more honour the Universitie Presse then those schoole
books which he had agreed to print for y<sup>e</sup> Londoners....</p>

<p class="pbq">He is continually defaming chyding and brawling
with your petitioner, often fighting with, beating,
threatning and vexing your petitioners servants, so
your petitioner and they are weary of their lives<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Daniel then proceeds to show that it will be more
honourable for the university, more beneficial to
scholars, and more agreeable to the charter to have
two or three printing-houses instead of one:</p>

<p class="pbq">For so the books printed in the University shall not
be monopolised but freely vented.</p>

<p class="pbq">The parting of the Printers will beget in them a
laudable emulation which of them shall deserve best....</p>

<p class="pbq">Whereas it is a common complaint that when schollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
have taken great paines in writing usefull bookes, they
cannot get them printed but at their own great charges.
It is probable that there will be cause of the like complaint
here in Cambridge, if there be but one printing house,
which likewise will be taken away, for it is likely if one
Printer will not, another will<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">The result of this petition is not recorded; but
it certainly did not lead to the dissolution of the
partnership, for in 1639 we find an elaborate agreement<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
between Thomas Buck and Roger Daniel
on the one side and six London stationers (Robert
Mead, John Parker, Miles Flesher<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, Robert Young,
Edward Brewster, John Legate<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>) relating to the
sale of bibles, service books, singing psalms, grammars
and other school books. The large stock of
these books printed at Cambridge was bought by
the London syndicate, who guaranteed to leave
sufficient copies in Cambridge to supply the needs
of the university, whilst Buck and Daniel undertook
not to print further copies of the books for
the space of ten years without the consent of the
Stationers.</p>

<p>From the preamble of this agreement it also
appears that John Buck had assigned his rights as
printer to Roger Daniel.</p>

<p class="p2">However difficult, not to say tyrannical, Thomas
Buck's dealings with his various partners, and however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
questionable some of his dealings with the
Stationers may have been, his name stands high in
the annals of Cambridge typography. The first
Cambridge edition of the Authorised Version was
printed by him in 1629, a fine book with an
elaborately engraved title-page. In the next year
two quarto editions were produced, and these were
followed by several other editions during the next
ten years. Buck and Daniel were so well satisfied
with their folio of 1638 ("perhaps the finest bible
ever printed at Cambridge") that they posted a
notice on the door of Great St Mary's Church
challenging scholars to find a mistake in it, and
offering a free bible to anyone who should do so.</p>

<p>"The <i>Bible</i>," says a document of about 1655,
"was never better printed than by Mr <i>Buck</i> and
Mr <i>Daniel</i>."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>It was about this time, too, that the encouragement
of the study of Arabic in the university
began. In 1626 Archbishop Usher had endeavoured
to obtain from Leyden matrices of Syriac, Arabic,
Ethiopic, and Samaritan letters for the use of the
University Press, but was forestalled by the Elzevirs<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Thomas Adams (afterwards Sir Thomas Adams,
Bart., Lord Mayor of London) had in 1632founded a professorship of Arabic and some years
later (probably in 1645) the Senate decreed, that
having established a press and such other apparatus
as should be required, they should devote their
attention to the production of books in Arabic, in
order that the fruits of the Adams benefaction
should be handed down to posterity and diffused
throughout the world<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. There is, however, no
record of Arabic printing at Cambridge until a
much later date<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>Buck was a scholar as well as a printer<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>; the edition
of <i>Poetae Graeci Minores</i> printed by him in
1635, which has a title-page engraved by William
Marshall, was described, though with some exaggeration,
as "the most elegant book of the Cantabrigian
press delivered to the public"; Mede's
<i>Clavis Apocalyptica</i> (second edition, 1632) is also
notable for its fine Hebrew type.</p>

<p>Apart from the typographical interest of the
work of Thomas Buck and his partners, there are
some famous names amongst the authors whose
works they printed. Those of Giles and Phineas
Fletcher, the two brothers who "head the line of
poets who were divines of the English church,"
are prominent in the list. The former's <i>Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Victorie</i> was reprinted in 1632 and 1640 and under
the name of Phineas (who, like his brother, had
contributed to <i>Sorrowes Joy</i> in 1603) we find
<i>Locustae, vel pietas jesuitica</i> (1627), the poem
which is said to have contributed to the inspiration
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>; and, in 1633, <i>Sylva Poetica</i>, <i>The
Purple Island</i>, and <i>Elisa or An Elegie Upon the
Unripe Decease of Sir Antonie Irby</i>.</p>

<p>A more famous work of the period is that of
George Herbert, Public Orator from 1619 to
1627, during which time, according to Walton, he
managed the office "with as becoming and grave a
gaiety, as any had ever before or since his time;
for he had acquired great learning, and was blessed
with a high fancy, a civil and sharp wit, and with a
natural elegance, both in his behaviour, his tongue,
and his pen." From his deathbed he sent a manuscript
to "his dear brother Ferrar," describing it as
"a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have
passed betwixt God and my soul, before I could
subject mine to the will of Jesus my Master; in
whose service I have now found perfect freedom."</p>

<p>This was the manuscript of <i>The Temple</i>, published
in 1633, and reprinted many times in the
following ten years.</p>

<p>Another of the 'sacred poets' whose works were
printed at Cambridge at this time is Richard Crashaw
(<i>Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber</i>, 1634).</p>

<p>John Donne is represented by a volume of <i>Six
Sermons upon severall occasions, preached before the
King, and elsewhere</i>, posthumously published in
1634; and Thomas Fuller, that loyal son and
historian of the university, by <i>The Historie of the
Holie Warre</i> (1639).</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But the most famous name of all is that of John
Milton, for at Cambridge was printed the first edition
of <i>Lycidas</i>. It was included in the <i>Obsequies to
the memorie of Mr Edward King</i> (1638)<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and the
University Library copy contains corrections in
Milton's own hand.</p>

<p>These few titles, selected from the long list of
Cambridge books of this period, are themselves a
justification of Bowes's conclusion that "the press
was in a condition of great activity during the
period that Buck was connected with it."</p>

<p>Buck, moreover, was active in university and
college affairs as well as at the Press; he was Esquire
Bedell from 1624 to 1670<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and was a benefactor
both to Jesus and St Catharine's Colleges<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>Roger Daniel, as has been seen above, represented
the business side of the partnership and kept
a bookshop in London. Thus on the title-page of
a bible of 1638 we read: "to be sold by Roger
Daniel at the Angell in Lumber Street, London."
Though Buck retained his interest in the Press
until 1668, Daniel's name appears by itself on
title-pages printed between 1640 and 1650.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Among the authors may be noted the names of
some of the Cambridge Platonists: Henry More's
<i>Ψυχωδία Platonica</i> was printed in 1642, his <i>Democritus
Platonissans</i> in 1646 and his <i>Philosophicall
Poems</i> (second edition) in 1647; Ralph Cudworth's
<i>Sermon before the House of Commons</i> was printed in
the same year.</p>

<p>Thomas Fuller's most popular work, <i>The Holy
State</i>, appeared in 1642&mdash;a small folio with an
engraved title-page on which the portrait of
Charles I is characteristically flanked by the emblematic
figures of Truth and Justice. A second
edition of the book appeared in 1648. Other noteworthy
books are the <i>Sermons</i> of Lancelot Andrewes
(1641), the second edition of Francis Quarles's
<i>Emblemes</i> (1643), Bede's <i>Historiae Ecclesiasticae
Gentis Anglorum Libri V</i> (1643) and William
Harvey's <i>Exercitatio Anatomica de Circulatione
Sanguinis</i> (1649). A less important medical tract
is <i>Warme Beere</i> (1641), a treatise in which are
expounded "many reasons that Beere so qualified
is farre more wholesome then that which is drunke
cold." In 1645 Daniel printed <i>Tachygraphy</i>, a
work which claimed to be "the most exact and
compendious methode of short and swift writing
that hath ever yet been published by any." It was
compiled by Thomas Shelton, "Authour and Professour
of the said Art," and a special interest is
attached to the book in that the principles of
shorthand expounded in it were those adopted by
Pepys in the writing of his <i>Diary</i>.</p>

<p>It was, however, the printing of political tracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that brought Daniel's name into greatest prominence.
In 1642, "by his Majesties speciall
command," he printed <i>His Majesties answer to the
Declaration of both Houses of Parliament, Concerning
the Commission of Array</i> and on 23 August
of the same year he was summoned to appear before
the House of Commons, which enjoined him "not
to print anything concerning the Proceedings of
Parliament, without the Consent or Order of one
or both Houses of Parliament." A few months later
the House of Commons again took offence at a
book printed at Cambridge (<i>The Resolving of Conscience</i>,
by Henry Fern); this time Daniel was
arrested, but was subsequently released on bail,
after Dr Holdsworth, the Vice-Chancellor, had
been specially summoned to the House of Commons,
under the escort of Captain Cromwell.</p>

<p>By an ordinance of 1649 Parliament recognised
the universities (together with London, York, and
Finsbury) as privileged printing-places; Daniel's
printing patent, however, was cancelled, on the
ground of neglect, in 1650.</p>

<p>He continued to print books in London after
that date, but the petition for his restoration to the
position of university printer in 1660 does not
seem to have borne fruit.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">PRINTERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND RESTORATION</p>


<p class="pn p2">The printer who succeeded Roger Daniel,
John Legate the younger, has already been
mentioned in connection with the agreement of
1639 between Buck and the Stationers. Admitted
freeman of the Stationers' Company in 1619, he
took over several of the books printed by his father,
including Thomas's <i>Dictionary</i>. For many years
before his appointment he had described himself
as printer to the university and shortly after the
grace for his election (5 July, 1650) he and William
Graves, another Cambridge stationer, "entered into
recognisances with two sureties of £300 each not to
print any seditious or unlicensed books, pamphlets,
or pictures, nor suffer their presses to be used for
that purpose"&mdash;a pledge similar to that given by
the brothers Buck in the previous year.</p>

<p class="b1">Perhaps the most interesting feature of Legate's
short tenure of the office of printer is the fact that
Thomas Buck, without resigning his patent, made
an agreement with him and Octavian Pulleyn by
which he undertook to hand over his printing rights
to the Stationers' Company of London:</p>

<p class="pbq">The said Mr Buck shall surcease to print in Cambridge,
and soe long as he shall forbeare to exercise his
printing place there, that the said Companie of Stationers ...
shall pay unto the said Mr Buck the summe of twenty
pounds per Annum....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">Neither the said Thomas Buck nor his brother John
Buck shall resyne their ... Patents for the Printers place,
without the consent of the aforesaid John Legate ... soe
as the said Mr Legate may enjoy the sole exercise of
Printing in the University of Cambridge....</p>

<p class="pbq">In regard Mr Buck hath many Bookes which he hath
lately printed in Cambridge now lieing upon his hand
(some whereof he hath lately printed whilst he freed
Mr Legate from takeing the share of the Presse in
Cambridge whereunto he had otherwise been obliged)
the said Companie of Stationers shall really, and bona
fide, use the utmost of their best indeavours to sell all
the said bookes....</p>

<p class="pbq">For all the letter in the Printinge house of Cambridge
(mentioned in founders' Bills and bought since Mr
Legate was first chosen to be a Printer in Cambridge,
as also the long Primmer and Pica-greeke ...) the
Companie of Stationers shall pay unto the said Thomas
Buck two full third parts of the several prices they cost....</p>

<p class="pbq">The said John Legate shall oblige himself soe to
exercise the Priviledge of Printing in the University of
Cambridge as may be most for the honor, and reputation
of the said University, soe as the said Mr Thomas and
John Buck may noe wayes be injured in their reputation,
but may safely forbeare the exercise of their severall
printinge Places in the said University<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p class="pbq">This last obligation, however, does not appear
to have been fulfilled, since Legate's patent was
cancelled for neglect in 1655<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">John Field, who followed him, was in close
touch with the Parliamentary party. Before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
appointment by grace of 12 October, 1655, he
had been "printer to the parliament" and had
produced several editions of the bible, as well as
a number of political tracts.</p>

<p class="b1"><i>The London Printers Lamentacon, or, the Press
opprest, and overprest</i> (? 1660) contained a violent
outburst against him:</p>

<p class="pbq">Who printed the pretended Act of the Commons of
England <i>for the setting up an High Court of Justice, for the
tryall of his Martyred Majesty in 1648</i>? Or, <i>the Acts for
abolishing King-ship, and renouncing the Royall Line and
Title of the Stuarts</i>? Or, <i>for the Declaring what Offences
should be adjudged Treason</i>?... or, <i>the Proclamation of 13.
of September 1652</i> after the fight at Worcester, <i>offering,
One Thousand pound to any person, to bring in his Majesties
person</i>? but only John Feild Printer to the Parliament
of England (and since by <i>Cromwell</i> was and is continued
Printer to the University of Cambridge!) ... Have
they<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> not invaded and still do intrude upon His Maiesties
Royall Priviledge, Praerogative and Praeeminence....
Have they not obtained, (and now keep in their actuall
possession) the Manuscript Copy of the last Translation
of the <i>holy Bible</i> in English (attested with the hands of
the Venerable and learned Translators in King <i>James</i>
his time) ever since 6 March 1655<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>?</p>

<p class="p1">On receiving his appointment Field built a "large
shop or printing-house" in Silver Street, the land
being leased to the university by Queens' College.
The new press stood on part of the site now occupied
by the master's lodge of St Catharine's College,
and served as the university printing house
until about 1827.</p>

<p>Between 1650 and the year of Field's death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
(1668) there was, as may be seen from Appendix <span class="smcap">II</span>,
a considerable output of books from the press. Not
many are of intrinsic importance, but the titles
show considerable variety and a further point of
interest is that the printer's copies of a large number
of <i>imprimaturs</i> of books printed between 1656 and
1692 have been preserved<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Orders "for the better
government of the presses and Printers" were reaffirmed
by the Vice-Chancellor and Heads in
1655 and it is clear that the university at this time
exercised a closer supervision over its press than
in the days when Buck conducted his independent
negotiations with the London Stationers. The
specimen <i>imprimatur</i> which is reproduced overleaf
shows the care with which Field preserved his
authority for printing any particular book.</p>

<p>One of the first books printed by Field was <i>The
History of the University of Cambridge</i> by Thomas
Fuller (1655), who, in spite of his Royalist convictions,
appears to have raised no objection to his
work being printed by one who styled himself "one
of his Highness's Printers."</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Cromwell's death in 1658 called forth the
customary <i>Musarum Cantabrigiensium Luctus &amp;
Gratulatio</i>, containing a Hebrew poem by Cudworth;
whilst two years later Field, with fine
impartiality, printed <i>Academiae Cantabrigiensis
ΣΩΣΤΡΑ</i>, as well as two editions of the speech delivered
by Richard Love in honour of the return of
Charles II and a sermon by John Spencer on the
same happy theme. Several bibles were printed
during this period, including a folio "with Chorograph
Sculps by T. Ogilby" (1660)<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. Field, however,
did not (in the earlier years of his career, at
any rate) maintain the high reputation of Cambridge
bibles established by Buck and Daniel; for in 1656
William Kilburne presented a statement to the Vice-Chancellor
showing a long list of errata in bibles
printed by Field in 1653, 1655, and 1656. These
errata were based upon an examination only of a
few sheets and in a note at the end of the list it is
stated:</p>

<p class="pbq">If those severall Bibles were read over throughout,
they would be found egregiously erroneous, without all
question; And of the severall Impressions, there were
about fower score Thousand printed, And all, or the
greatest part of them sold by Mr Field and dispersed,
to the great scandall of the Church<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Amongst the editions of classical authors printed
during this period may be noted Statius (1651), Poetae
Minores Graeci (1652, 1661, 1667), Terence
(1654), Cicero, <i>de Officiis</i> etc. (1660), Homer (1664),
Sophocles (1665, 1669), Sallust (1665).</p>

<p>Editions of Euclid appeared in 1655 and 1665,
the former by Isaac Barrow, afterwards Lucasian
Professor and Master of Trinity College.</p>

<p>A work which has a special interest in the history
of the study of botany in Cambridge is <i>Catalogus
plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium</i> (1660) to
which ("in gratiam tyronum") various indexes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
were added. The author was John Ray, of St Catharine's,
afterwards Fellow of Trinity College.</p>

<p>Controversial theology is, of course, prominent;
<i>Ichabod: Or Five Groans of the Church</i> (1663)
prudently foresees and passionately bewails the
Church's Second Fall and on the title-page is a
mournful female figure holding a church in her
lap.</p>

<p class="b1">A work of lighter fancy is <i>University Queries, In
a gentle Touch by the By</i> (1659). One of the queries
propounded runs:</p>

<p class="pbq">Whether if the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford
should be annihilated, and the revenues imployed to the
publique affairs of this Commonwealth, (Religion being
now out of date, and learning of no use, where men are
so generally inspired,) it is not fitting that Brasen Nose
College in Oxford should be exempted from that general
devastation, as a memorial of the Respect they bore to
Oliver late Lord Protector.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">This period was not free from disputes between
the university and the London Stationers. Field and
his partner had in 1655 bought from Christopher
and Matthew Barker "ye Manuscript Coppie of the
Bible," and the right of printing it, for £1200. In
August 1662 two letters were received by the Vice-Chancellor
from Charles II, ordering the university
to "forbeare to print the Bible and new Testament
otherwise than according to the Orders of 1623 and
1629." The university appealed against this and Lord
Clarendon appointed a day for hearing both parties&mdash;the
King's printers and the university. Field undertook
not to publish any prayer-books until further
orders; Clarendon proposed "an accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
by way of agreement," and John Pearson, Bishop
of Chester, advised the university to make a composition
with its rivals. From another correspondent,
who signs himself W. D.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, the Vice-Chancellor
received very different advice:</p>

<p class="pbq">The University's priviledge is looked upon as a trust
for the publick good, and theire printing of these bookes
will force the Londoners to print something tolerably
true ... who otherwise looking meerly at gaine will
not care how corruptly they print, witness the 200
blasphemy's w<sup>ch</sup> Mr B. found in theire bibles; &amp; the
millions of faults in their schoolbookes, increasing in
every edition, so long as Mr B's composition with the
stationers held ... whence it was that often errors were
drunk in in grammer schooles scarcely after to be corrected
at the University, unlesse schoolm<sup>rs</sup> were so careful
as to correct bookes by hand before they lett theire
boys have them. It being therefore the University's
interest to have youths well and truly grounded in school
bookes &amp; the interest of the whole nation to have true
bibles, I cannot but think the University trustees in
both respects, &amp; feare they would afterwards rew the
betraying of so great a trust if they should sell it by
farming<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p class="pn p1">The university appears to have taken this advice and
a New Testament printed by Field appeared in 1666.</p>

<p>Field's name is found in the St Botolph's parish
books from 1657 to 1668, and in 1660 he was
churchwarden.</p>

<p>He died on 12 August, 1668, and no successor
was immediately appointed, a letter being received
by the Vice-Chancellor from the King requesting
that the office should not be filled for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point the names of Thomas and John
Buck re-appear. In a petition to the Vice-Chancellor
they repeat accusations, made against
Field in 1665, both of false printing and of failure
to pay sums due to the two brothers<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Whether the
claim against Field's estate was substantiated does
not appear, but it is evident that Thomas and John
Buck still held their printer's patents in 1668.</p>

<p>The first election made after Field's death was
that of Matthew Whinn, Registrary, in March,
1669; this seems, however, to have been a purely
formal appointment and Field's successor was in fact
John Hayes, who was elected in October of the same
year, the printing having previously been leased to
him for £100 a year, on the condition that there
should be no further treaty with the London Stationers.</p>

<p>The books printed during the earlier part of
Hayes's tenure of office are similar in general character
to those of his predecessor John Field. Dyer
describes the Andronicus Rhodius of 1679 as an
<i>editio optima</i> and among the other books of the
period will be found the usual congratulatory, or
lachrymatory, symposia evoked by the funeral of
Henrietta Maria, the marriage of William and Mary,
the death of Charles II; several university and
assize sermons; editions of Homer, Sophocles, Euripides,
Terence, Lucretius, Ovid, Livy, Sallust;
Crashaw's <i>Steps to the Temple</i> and the second edition
of <i>Poemata et Epigrammata</i> (1670); John Ray's
<i>Collection of Proverbs</i> (1670 and 1678); editions of
à Kempis, <i>De Christo Imitando</i> (1685), of Erasmus,
<i>Enchiridion</i> (1685), and of North's Plutarch's
<i>Lives</i> (1676); as well as bibles, prayer-books, and
almanacks. The almanacks are an interesting feature
of Cambridge printing at this period. Every year,
under a pseudonymous heading (Dove, Swallow,
Pond, Swan, etc.), a number of these attractive little
books were issued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The title-page of <i>Swan</i> (1675) is reproduced here
and in <i>A Brief Chronology</i> included in the book
the history of the world is summarised from the
Creation (4004 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) and the Flood (2347 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) to
the building of Cambridge (635 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) and the peace
with the Dutch (1674 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>).</p>

<p class="b1">At this time the printing of Hebrew seems to
have fallen into disuse, as Isaac Abendana, writing
from Cambridge in 1673, complains:</p>

<p class="pbq">Paravi nuperrime versionem ... sed his desunt characteres
Hebr.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Hayes probably remained as printer&mdash;in name,
at any rate&mdash;until his death in 1705, since there is
in existence a bond of 1703, by which John Hayes
and John Collyer (a London stationer) promised to
pay the university £150 a year so long as Hayes
continued as printer<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1">A pleasant description of the printing-house in
1689 is preserved in the diary of Samuel Sewall, an
American judge who visited Cambridge in that year:</p>

<p class="pbq">By it [Katherine Hall] the Printing Room, which is
about 60 foot long and 20 foot broad. Six presses. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
my cousin Hull and my name printed there. Paper
windows, and a pleasant garden along one side between
Katherine Hall and that. Had there a print of the
Combinations<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">During Hayes's lifetime several other appointments
to the office of printer were made: John Peck
(1680), Hugh Martin (1682), James Jackson (1683),

Jonathan Pindar (1697)<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. All these appointments
seem, however, to have been merely formal. They
were, presumably, the last to be made in accordance
with the original provision of the charter of
1534, by which the university was empowered to
elect three printers simultaneously. Far more important
was the arrival of Cornelius Crownfield. As
early as 1694 his name appears on the title-page of
Joshua Barnes's edition of Euripides of which Dyer
says: "the magnificence and typographical excellence
... form an epoch in the History of Greek
Printing at Cambridge. It reminds us of the blooming
infancy of this useful art, and the Harlem press";
and Crownfield's appointment, in 1698 or earlier,
as Inspector of the Press, was part of an energetic
movement to establish Cambridge printing on a new
basis.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">RICHARD BENTLEY&mdash;THE FIRST PRESS SYNDICATE</p>

<p class="pn p2 b1">In the movement for the revival of Cambridge
typography at the end of the seventeenth century
the most prominent name is that of Richard
Bentley.</p>

<p class="pbq">The renovation of the University Press (writes his
biographer, Monk), which had continued in decay since
the Usurpation, was projected by him, and mainly
accomplished through his agency. New buildings, new
presses, and new types were all requisite; and the University
itself being destitute of funds, a subscription
for these purposes was procured principally by his exertions;
and the deficiency was made up by the Senate
borrowing a thousand pounds. The task of ordering
types of every description was absolutely committed to
his discretion by a <i>grace</i> in very complimentary terms;
and the power of attorney given him on this occasion is
the most unlimited I recollect ever to have seen<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">The reference to the continuous decay of the
Press during fifty years savours of exaggeration.
The typographical inaccuracies in Field's bibles, it
is true, became notorious; but it was Field who built
the new printing-house and from 1655 onwards there
is no year in which the continuity of book-production
is broken.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On the other hand, it is clear that the old system
inaugurated by the charter of 1534 had broken
down. Under that system the university simply
licensed tradesmen (who might, or might not, be
members of the university) to print and sell books;
and the proper working of the Press was dependent
on the capabilities of the individual printer. He might
be bullied by the London Stationers, as were
Thomas Thomas and John Legate (the elder), and
involve the university in a long series of petitions
and counter-petitions; on the other hand he might
make commercially profitable arrangements with
the Stationers' Company, as did Thomas Buck, and
disregard the interests of the university; he might
accept the office with no intention of printing,
but simply in the interests of a family monopoly, as
did Francis Buck; or he might neglect his duties
altogether, as did John Legate, the younger.</p>

<p>Consequently, the standard of typography, the
expansion of the Press buildings, and the purchase
of new type were at the mercy of the commercial
fortunes of the holders of the patents.</p>

<p>It was with the object of bringing the Press directly
under the control of the university and, at the same
time, of making it worthier of Cambridge scholarship
that the movement associated with Bentley's
name began.</p>

<p class="b1">The formal initiative came from the Chancellor
himself. On 29 June, 1696, the Duke of Somerset
wrote to the members of the Senate:</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span></p>

<p class="pbq2">As I have y<sup>e</sup> honour to be a servant to you all,
soe am I ever thinking of w<sup>t</sup> may be most for y<sup>r</sup> interest,
and for y<sup>e</sup> support of that reputation, and great character
w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> University have soe worthily deserved in y<sup>e</sup><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
opinion of all good, and of all learned men: &amp; in my
poore thoughtes, noe way more effectual, than the
recovering y<sup>e</sup> fame of y<sup>r</sup> own printing those great, and
excellent writinges, y<sup>t</sup> are soe frequently published from
y<sup>e</sup> Members of y<sup>r</sup> own body; w<sup>ch</sup> tho' very learned,
sometimes have been much prejudiced by y<sup>e</sup> unskillful
handes of uncorrect printers. Therefore it is, y<sup>t</sup> I doe
at this time presume to lay before you all, a short, and
imperfect Scheame (here enclosed) of some thoughtes
of mine, by way of a foundation, for you to finishe, and
to make more perfect; w<sup>ch</sup> tho' never soe defective at
present, yett they have mett with aprobation among
some publick spirited men (much deserving the name
of friends to us) who have freely contributed eight
hundred pounds towards y<sup>e</sup> Carying on this good, and
most beneficiall worke.</p>

<p class="pbq">Now, Gentlemen, their is nothing wanting of my part,
to endeavour the procuring the like su[̄m]e againe from
others, but y<sup>r</sup> aprobation, and consent, to have a Presse
once more erected at Cambridge: and when that shall
bee resolved on, then to give a finishing hand (like great
Masters as you are) to my unfinished thoughtes, that I
may be proude in having done some thing, y<sup>t</sup> you think
will bee for your service; w<sup>ch</sup> I doe hope will bee a
meanes to procure mee a general pardonn from you all,
for laying this Matter before you, having noe other
ambition, than to bee thought your most obedient and
most faithfull humble servant.</p>

<p class="pn60 reduct"><span class="smcap">Somerset.</span></p>

<p class="p1">The duke himself lent the university the sum of
£200 towards the cost of the scheme<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and the Senate
quickly acted on his letter, for on 10 July a grace
was passed authorising Bentley to act on behalf of
the university and the power of attorney, referred
to by Monk, gave him</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbqn">potestatem generalem et mandatum speciale omnimoda
literarum et characterum genera ab exteris gentibus
comparandi et omnia ad idem negotium spectantia et
pertinentia pro arbitratu suo perquirendi et sumptibus

<p class="p1">"The commission," says Monk, "was executed
with promptitude and judgment: he procured to
be cast in Holland those beautiful types which
appear in Talbot's Horace, Kuster's Suidas,
Taylor's Demosthenes, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p class="b1">The next step was a grace of the Senate for the
appointment of the first Press Syndicate:</p>

<p class="pbq center">lect. &amp; concess. 21 Jan. 169⅞.</p>

<p class="p1">Though Hayes retained his position as printer,
the active part in the renovation of the Press was
taken by Crownfield in his capacity as Inspector.
Crownfield is described by Ames as "a Dutchman,
who had been a soldier, and a very ingenious man";
and the earliest orders of the newly-appointed
Curators seem to have been carried out by him.</p>

<p>A new printing-house, facing Queens' Lane, was
built to the north of that established by John Field;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and for some years it appears that both may have
been in use<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. But in 1716 a grace was passed allotting
the new printing-house (as being <i>Academiae
alioquin infructuosum</i>) to the use of the Professors of
Chemistry and Anatomy for lectures and experiments,
and the printing was carried on at the older
press at the corner of Queens' Lane and Silver Street.</p>

<p class="b1">The Curators' activities may be illustrated by
some extracts from the first Order Book<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>:</p>

<p class="p1">The next extract shows the executive arrangements

<p class="p1 b1">This last entry refers to the printers' annual holiday
of which Randall Holme, writing in 1688, says</p>

<p class="pbq">It is customary for all journeymen to make every year,
new paper windows about <i>Bartholomew-tide</i>, at which
time the master printer makes them a feast called a <i>waygoose</i>
to which is invited the corrector, founder, smith,
ink-maker, etc., who all open their purses and give to
the workmen to spend in the tavern or ale-house after
the feast. From which time they begin to work by candle
light<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">By 1701 Bentley's activities had begun to bear
fruit.</p>

<p class="pbqn">Already (says Monk) some handsome editions of Latin
Classics had been printed.... Terence had been edited by
Leng, of Catharine Hall, afterwards Bishop of Norwich;
Horace by Talbot, the Hebrew Professor; Catullus,
Tibullus, and Propertius by the Hon. Arthur Annesley,
Representative for the University; and Virgil by J.
Laughton of Trinity.</p>

<p class="p1">Nor was it only in Holland that search was made
for beautiful types. In 1700 Matthew Prior was
sent, on behalf of the university, to procure Greek
type (the famous <i>Grecs du Roi</i>) from the Paris press.
The negotiations, however, fell through owing to
the demand of the French that on the title-page of
any book for which their type was used there should
be added after the words <i>typis Academicis</i>, a full acknowledgment
in the form <i>Caracteribus Græcis
e typographeo regio Parisiensi</i>. Correspondence
passed between Prior, the Earl of Manchester, the
Chancellor, and the Abbé Bynon, but the university
refused to comply with this condition<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the books printed about this time we may
note first the works edited by Bentley himself.</p>

<p>The title-page of the famous edition of Horace
(1711) is reproduced here and a full account both
of its compilation and of its reception may be read
in Monk's <i>Life</i>:</p>

<p class="pbqn">This publication had been long and anxiously expected;
and its appearance excited much sensation and surprise.
There were found between seven and eight hundred
alterations of the common readings of Horace; all of which,
contrary to the general practice of classical editors, were
introduced into the text.... This book was, it must be
confessed, unlike any edition of a Latin author ever before
given to the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill111" id="ill111">i111</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">TITLE-PAGE OF BENTLEY'S EDITION OF HORACE, 1711</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Especially characteristic of the atmosphere in
which Bentley lived and worked is "the important
affair of the dedication." Having discovered that
the Earl of Oxford was "anxious that the world
should know, that his ancestors were related to the
Veres and Mortimers of former centuries, and that
his family estate in Herefordshire had been in possession
of the Harleys since the reign of Edward
the First," Bentley took particular pains that these
glories should be "fully and accurately displayed."
"Good taste" comments Monk "had not yet abolished
the fashion, which demanded from every dedicator,
whether classical or vernacular, the most unsparing
praise that language could supply."</p>

<p>Bentley's edition of Terence (1726) was designed,
characteristically, to supplant and extinguish that
of Francis Hare, Dean of Worcester. The text was
corrected "in not less than a thousand places" and
in every line the first accented syllable of every <i>dipodia</i>
was marked with an acute accent&mdash;"a laborious
task, which must have vastly increased the trouble
of correcting the press." Included in the first half
of the volume were a <i>Schediasma</i> or dissertation upon
the metres of Terence and Bentley's <i>Commencement
Oration</i> of 1725, on the occasion of the creation
of seven Doctors of Divinity. The second half
of the book consisted of an edition of Phaedrus and
Publius Syrus, the Phaedrus being undertaken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
anticipate an edition projected by Hare containing
emendations "of the most daring class."</p>

<p><i>A Sermon upon Popery</i>, preached by Bentley before
the university on 5 November, 1715, and printed
in the same year, is of interest not only as an expression
of the vigorous No-Popery spirit of 1715,
but as supplying material and phraseology for the
sermon recited by Corporal Trim in the second book
of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>.</p>

<p>It was Bentley, too, who arranged for the publication
of a second edition of Newton's <i>Principia</i>
in 1713. "The first impression being entirely exhausted,"
says Monk, "the lovers of philosophy
were, in a manner, debarred access to the fountain
of truth" and Bentley engaged Roger Cotes to
supervise the new edition.</p>

<p>Into the history of Bentley's many controversies
it is fortunately unnecessary to enter, but one of his
pamphlets, which brought the university printer
into the Vice-Chancellor's court on a charge of
libel, must be mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1721 there appeared a pamphlet, written by
Conyers Middleton, but published anonymously
in London, entitled <i>Remarks, Paragraph by Paragraph,
upon the Proposals lately publish'd by Richard
Bentley, for a New Edition of the Greek Testament and
Latin Version</i>, and full of "sheer personal malice."
Bentley's proposals were described as "low and
paltry higgling to squeeze our money from us,"
reminiscent of "those mendicants in the streets, who
beg our charity with an <i>half sheet of proposals</i> pinned
upon their breasts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Bentley's reply was prompt and vigorous; he
chose to assume that the author of the pamphlet
was Dr John Colbatch, the Casuistical Professor<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,
and answered him in what Monk describes as
the vocabulary of Billingsgate. "Cabbage-head,"
"Maggot," "Gnawing-rat," "Mountebank" were
some of the terms used. "He never," wrote Bentley,
"broaches a piece of mere knavery, without a preface
about his conscience; nor ever offers to us downright
nonsense, without eyes, muscles, and shoulders
wrought up into the most solemn posture of gravity."</p>

<p>This was too much, even for academic controversy
of the eighteenth century; Colbatch, having
first disavowed the authorship of the <i>Remarks</i>, appealed
to the Heads of Colleges. This body declared
the book to be "a most virulent and scandalous
libel" and Crownfield was prosecuted in the Vice-Chancellor's
Court for having sold it. Dr Crosse,
the Vice-Chancellor, was a "quiet and timid man"
and after hazarding a judgment in Crownfield's
favour, adjourned the case. In the next year Bentley
was cited to appear in the Vice-Chancellor's Court
to give evidence concerning the libel. "There was
no difficulty," says Monk, "in obtaining the citation,
but a great one in getting it served upon the
Master: the Esquire-beadles ... were all as averse to
such perilous service, as the mice in the fable were
to undertake the office of belling the cat." One of
the beadles, however, was bribed with a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fee, and Bentley offered no resistance. Instead,
he contrived, by an exchange with a brother-chaplain,
to be on duty at St James's during the
month in which the Court was to assemble and
eventually the proceedings against him were abandoned.</p>

<p>The most ambitious work which the University
Press undertook about this time was an edition of
the Suidas Lexicon in three volumes folio. For this
enterprise Bentley was chiefly responsible. Ludolf
Kuster, a professor from Berlin, had collated three of
the Suidas manuscripts at Paris and was invited by
Bentley to take up his residence at Cambridge
and to publish his edition of the lexicon at the
Press. Accordingly on 4 October, 1701, the
university made an agreement with John Owen,
an Oxford stationer, by which Owen undertook to
purchase an edition of 1500 copies (150 on large
paper) of Suidas in three volumes at the price of
£1 10<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i> per sheet<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1">The exact relation of Owen to Cambridge is
not quite clear. Evidently, he was a protegé of
Bentley and though there is no record of his
official appointment as a Cambridge printer, several
books bear his imprint as <i>Typographus</i>, including
Cellarius, <i>Geographia</i> 1703; Ockley, <i>Introductio</i>
1706; Caesar, 1706; Minucius Felix, 1707; Sallust,
1710<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. The word <i>typographus</i>, as Bowes pointed
out, is used rather loosely and Owen seems only to
have been the publisher of the books quoted; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other hand, there are among Crownfield's vouchers
for 1705 the following:</p>

<p class="pn60 reduct">June 23. 1705</p>

<p class="pbq">Then received of Mr Corn. Crownfield (for the use
of Mr Davies, and for correcting Caesars Commentary)
the summe of thirty seven shillings and four pence,
being for 28 sheets at 16<i>d</i> the sheet from A to Ee,
inclusive by me</p>

<p class="pbq">Compos'd in Caesar's Commentary's the sheets Ccc,
Ddd, Eee, Fff at 8<i>s</i> the sheet&mdash;<i>l</i>1 12<i>s</i> 0<i>d</i></p>

<p class="pbqn">Sept. 17. 1705</p>
<p class="pn60 reduct">Receiv'd by <span class="smcap">John Owen</span></p>

<p class="p1">These receipts appear to show that Owen actually
was at work as a compositor upon Davies's edition
of Caesar which appeared with the imprint <i>Impensis
Joannis Oweni, Typographi</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p>From passages in Bentley's correspondence it
also appears that Owen travelled in Holland on
Bentley's behalf in 1706<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>But long before this Owen had found himself
unable, "through great poverty and being imprisoned
on the amount of debts contracted," to
carry out the Suidas agreement, and on 8 May, 1703,
a new contract was made with Sir Theodore Janssen,
who had already supplied Owen with large quantities
of paper, for the completion of the work at the
joint expense of the university and of Janssen himself,
the editor's fee being fixed at £200<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been noted above, however, the Press continued
to print certain other books for Owen. Thus
Janssen writes to Crownfield on 19 October, 1704:</p>

<p class="pbqn">I have sent you to-day 150 Reams of fine genoa paper
which is to be for y<sup>e</sup> use of M<sup>r</sup> J<sup>on</sup> Owen when he hath
signed an agreement such as D<sup>r</sup> Bentley doth require ...<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">In later years Owen seems to have laid his misfortunes
at Bentley's door, since, in a dedication
written by him to "Elias Abenaker of London,
Gent." and prefixed to Ockley's translation of Modena,
<i>History of the present Jews</i> (ed. 1711), he
writes:</p>

<p class="pbqn">I ... want Words to tell the World how much I am your
Debtor, how often you have rescued me and my whole
Family from the Jaws of Destruction; what noble Assistances
you have supplied me with, to raise my Fortune
in the World, and put my Affairs into a prosperous and
flourishing Condition, had not a Person of an high Character,
and a pretending Encourager of Arts and Sciences,
and Printing in particular, (by the Encouragement of
whose specious Promises I was induced to leave Oxford)
been as Sedulous and Industrious to ruine and destroy
me, by such Injustice and Cruelties, which if I should
particularize, would gain Credit with few but those of the
University of Cambridge, where the Fact is notoriously
known<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">In the meantime Kuster's edition of Suidas had
duly appeared in 1705:</p>

<p class="pbq">Kuster (writes Monk) having now, by means of his
[Bentley's] patronage, completed the three noble volumes
of his Suidas, their appearance raised the fame of the
editor, while it excited public admiration at the spirit
and liberality of the University of Cambridge in undertaking
so magnificent a publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Correspondence between Janssen and Crownfield
throws some interesting side-lights on business details&mdash;the
fixing of the price and the choice of selling
agents<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>:</p>

<p class="pbq">Now that y<sup>e</sup> hurry of treating her Maj<sup>ty</sup> is over<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
(writes Janssen) I hope y<sup>e</sup> University will come speedily
to a resolution at what rate to sell Suidas, I would not
have them to think of too high a price and I believe 3<i>£</i>
will be rather too much hoever I leave it to them but I
hope they will not exceed 3£ which is 20<i>s</i> a volume.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">D<sup>r</sup> Bentley had told me you would write to some booksellers
in Holl<sup>d</sup>. Since we refused M<sup>r</sup> Mortier's offers
it might perhaps be of service but I think we could not
pitch on a fitter person for disposing of a good quantity
of Suidas beyond sea.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Bentley's financial negotiations with the Dutch
booksellers were apparently not successful, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
copies of the <i>Lexicon</i> were disposed of to foreign
booksellers by the method of exchange:</p>

<p class="pbq">Feby 1<sup>th</sup> 170<sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub>. Agreed then also y<sup>t</sup> foreign booksellers
be treated with for an exchange of an hundred<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Suidas's, for a number of bookes w<sup>ch</sup> shall be esteem'd
of equal value, &amp; y<sup>t</sup> Catalogues of proper bookes w<sup>th</sup>
their respective prises, be procur'd from them to be approv'd
of by y<sup>e</sup> University.</p>

<p class="p1">The succession of troubles encountered by the
university both in the production and distribution
of this book illustrates the difficulties of the Curators
in attempting to grapple with the details of stock-keeping
and accountancy. By 1732 "part of y<sup>e</sup>
impression was in y<sup>e</sup> University warehouse and y<sup>e</sup>
rest was got into M<sup>r</sup> Innys's<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> hands in London, but
in such manner, y<sup>t</sup> neither had a perfect book."</p>

<p class="b1">After some two or three years of negotiation for
the mutual purchase of sheets at ½<i>d</i> a piece, the university,
having bought the whole of Innys's stock
for £400, acquired 410 complete sets of the work
and appointed a Syndicate to dispose of them. The
Syndics, however, found remaindering difficult:</p>

<p class="pbq">It were well (says the writer of a memorandum of
1749) if we could get some one to take them all off our
hands at almost any rate. I have tried Knapton and
Whiston in vain. They durst not venture on the whole:
but advise to advertize them at 30<sup>s</sup> a Book, and let y<sup>e</sup>
Booksellers have them at 25<sup>s</sup>....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">I have hopes y<sup>t</sup> Vailliant may take them all at 25<sup>s</sup> a
book, especially if he be allowed time for payment of the
money, &amp; y<sup>e</sup> University would take some of it in books,
which we really want for y<sup>e</sup> Rustat Library<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Eventually, in 1752, 75 sets were disposed of to
T. Merrill (a Cambridge bookseller) at one guinea
each and the rest seem to have been exchanged<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
So ended the most ambitious of the early publishing
enterprises of the university.</p>

<p class="b1">Amongst the other books printed during this
period, editions of the classics are prominent. The
titles of these will be found in Appendix <span class="smcap">II</span> and
Davies's editions of Cicero, Barnes's Anacreon
(1705) and Homer (1711), Taylor's Lysias (1740)
may be specially noted. The edition of the <i>Medea</i>
and <i>Phoenissae</i> of Euripides by W. Piers (1703)
contains, in its preface, an interesting tribute to the
renovation of Cambridge typography:</p>

<p class="pbq">Si <i>Typorum elegantiam</i> mireris, gratias merito ingentes
habeto <i>Illustrissimo Principi</i> Carolo <i>Duci</i> Somersetensium
<i>munificentissimo nostrae Academiae Cancellario</i>, cui Cordi
est <i>nostrum</i> imo <i>suum</i> denuò revixisse <i>Typographéum</i>.</p>

<p class="p1">Mathematics is represented primarily by the
second edition of Newton's <i>Principia</i> (1713), by
Le Clerc's <i>Physica</i> (1700 etc.), by Robert Green's
<i>Principles of Natural Philosophy</i> (1712&mdash;an anti-Newtonian
treatise) and by the <i>Praelectiones</i> (1707
and 1710) and other works of W. Whiston; biography
by Knight's <i>Life of Erasmus</i> (1726); Oriental
studies by Ockley's <i>Introductio ad Linguas
Orientales</i> (1706) and Lyons's <i>Hebrew Grammar</i>
(1735).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>A work of more general interest is the first edition
of Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Christian Morals</i>, published
from the <span class="smcap">ms</span> of the Author by John Jeffery
and printed by Crownfield in 1716.</p>

<p class="p1">Between 1725 and 173<sup>8</sup>/<sub>9</sub> there are no entries
in the Curators' minute-book; the driving power of
Bentley's energy and enthusiasm was flagging and
the Press had become a source of pecuniary loss to
the university. The agreements of 1706 and 1727
with the Stationers, by which the university surrendered
the right of printing a large number of
school books in return for money payments, no doubt
represent an attempt to meet this difficulty<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly in December, 1730, it was resolved to
lease the university's right of printing bibles and
prayer-books to "Mr James &amp; Company" for the
sum of £100 per annum, an additional £5 per annum
to be paid during the lifetime of Jonathan
Pindar, whose formal resignation had been arranged
by a grace of 28 August<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>This arose out of an application which has a
special interest in the history of printing.</p>

<p>About the beginning of 1730 William Fenner, a
London stationer,</p>

<p class="pbqn">did bring up from Edinburgh a Scotsman named W<sup>m</sup>
Ged; who had or pretended to have found out the Art
of casting, upon Plates, whole Pages of Letters ... w<sup>ch</sup>
'twas thought would be of great advantage to the publick,
as well as to the proprietors of the Invention.</p>

<p class="p1">This invention came to the notice of a type-founder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
named Thomas James who was so much
struck by its possibilities that he was</p>

<p class="pbqn">of opinion that the Design of printing by such plates
would in short time be brought to such perfection as
would greatly injure if not wholly ruine the business of
letter-founding, by w<sup>ch</sup> he then made shift to support a
large family.</p>

<p class="p1">Accordingly a partnership was formed between
Ged, Fenner, and Thomas James. The design, it
was alleged, "had at that time all imaginable appearance
of Success"; Thomas James, being unable
to get any help from his father ("a Clergyman then
living upw<sup>ds</sup> of 85 years of age, who had, upon
a small Endowm<sup>t</sup> in Hampshire, brought up a
numerous family"), applied to his brother John, an
architect at Greenwich, for financial assistance. John
James came into the partnership, paying an entrance
fee of £100, and, as the invention of stereotype plates
was likely to be used with most advantage for the
printing of bibles and prayer-books, undertook to
apply for a licence to the University of Cambridge&mdash;"the
only one at that time unemploied."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>This application was successful and the lease was
granted to Fenner on 23 April, 1731; Fenner's
name was used as that of the only member of the
partnership who was a stationer, and John James
gave a bond for £100.</p>

<p>The plates were at first made in London, at a
house in Bartholomew Close, but in the summer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
1732 a house was hired in Cambridge and all the
materials and implements moved thither. "For y<sup>e</sup>
better prosecuting the Affair," a certain James
Watson was sent to Holland "as well as to hire
Men, as to buy Presses" and several Dutchmen
were employed in printing the nonpareil bible
and the small book of common prayer by the new
process.</p>

<p>But the business did not prosper. Ged quarrelled
with Fenner and "left the whole business at a stand,
Secreting or taking with him several Tools and other
things to which he had no Right"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>; Baskett, the
king's printer, filed a Bill in Chancery against Fenner
for printing bibles; the injunction was subsequently
withdrawn, but meanwhile John James was
losing confidence in the scheme and growing anxious
about his money; he urged Fenner to "go on with
the Cambridge Patent Work in common Type Way
by the Assistance of Mr Watson, <i>and have nothing
farther to do in the Plate Way</i>." "As far as I can
learn," wrote James in another letter (28 Nov. 1732),
"the Booksellers all agree that the Prayer-Book that
is done will by no means pass. So that to proceed
farther in this Way will but run us more and more
out of Pocket." Finally, Fenner died in debt in
1734; four specimens of his work in Cambridge
have survived: an octavo Book of Common Prayer,
Thomas Johnson's <i>Letter to Mr Chandler</i>, John
Colbatch's <i>Examination of the marriage treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Charles II</i>, and <i>A Collection of Poems</i>, by the Author
of <i>A Poem on the Cambridge Ladies</i>.</p>

<p>His widow, Mary Fenner, carried on such business
as was left and a bitter controversy, recalling
the days of Thomas Buck, arose between her and
her deceased husband's partners. The brothers
James declared that they were £1000 out of pocket
and had received not a penny in return; that Fenner
had taken a grossly unfair advantage of the lease
being in his name. Mrs Fenner, in reply, maintained
that her husband had borne the brunt of many
business difficulties alone and that his appeals to his
partners for help and co-operation had been neglected.</p>

<p>In their complaints to the Vice-Chancellor Thomas
and John James did not mince their words:</p>

<p class="pbqn">I humbly request (writes Thomas) that my Brother and
I may be heard; that so the Scene of Iniquity carried on
by Mr Fenner and now prosecuted by his Widow may be
laid open ... for I do not find the change of Mrs Fenner's
Religion has made any alteration in her morals.</p>

<p class="pbq">As to what Fenner's wife (writes John) (who I fear is
of as bad a principle as he was) may alledge, I can only
say, she has no other cause of complaint, than that I
refused to throw away all I had in y<sup>e</sup> world, for the Knave
her husband to make Ducks and Drakes with.</p>

here<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, but one short letter from Mrs Fenner
to the Vice-Chancellor is worth preserving:</p>

<p class="pn60 reduct">Mary Fenner</p>

<p class="p1">Only one book bearing the imprint of Mary Fenner
(the sixth edition of Bentley's <i>Boyle Lectures</i>,
1735) has been preserved and her association with
the university came to an end in 1738. In that
year she relinquished her lease and John James
agreed to pay £150 in settlement of the university's
claim upon the ill-fated partnership.</p>

<p>The chief cause of the failure of the Press to fulfil
the high hopes of 1696 appears, in Monk's words,</p>

<p class="pbqn">to have been the want of a permanent committee of
management, a measure which, however obvious, was
not adopted till many years afterwards. In the meantime,
the receipt and disbursement of large sums of
money, as well as the necessary negotiations with persons
of business, were entrusted to the individuals holding
the annual office of Vice-Chancellor, who in many cases
possessed no previous acquaintance with the concern;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a system which inevitably led to injurious and almost
ruinous consequences.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">This state of affairs is reflected in the preamble of
the grace of 1737:</p>

<p class="pbq">Cum prelum typographicum in usum et commoditatem
Academicam olim destinatum per quadraginta retro
annos ita negligenter fuerit administratum, ut Academiam
oneraverit sumptu ultra bis mille et trecentas libras....</p>

<p class="p1">A Syndicate was accordingly appointed with
plenary powers over the Press for three years.</p>

<p>This Syndicate "took the State of the Press into
Consideration" purchasing new types, presses and
other materials; and "that they might be able to
retain good Hands there, by securing them constant
Employment, began to print an Impression
of the Bible in 12<sup>mo</sup>."</p>

<p>The further measures taken for the development
of the bible trade will be recorded in the next chapter.
Here it may be noted that one important modification
of the Copyright Act, which had been finally
passed in 1710, was made in 1739; in that year a
new act repealed the clause which empowered the
Vice-Chancellors of the two universities to set and
reform the prices of books.</p>

<p>In 1712, 1735, and subsequent years clauses were
also included in the acts imposing duties on paper
by which, "for the Encouragement of Learning"
the University Presses were allowed a "drawback"
on paper used "in the printing any Bookes in the
Latin Greek Orientall or Northern Languages."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">VI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PRINTERS</p>

<p class="pn p2">Crownfield retired from the office of
printer in 1740 and received a pension from
the university until his death in 1743<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. He was a
bookseller as well as a printer and seems to have
done some binding as well<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. His bookselling business
was carried on after his death by his son James,
and a book of 1744 is described on the title-page as
"printed for J. Crownfield."</p>

<p>His successor was Joseph Bentham, appointed
first by the Curators as 'Inspector' on 28 March,
1740<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, and elected printer on 14 December of the
same year.</p>

<p>Bentham was the son of Samuel Bentham, Vicar
of Wichford, near Ely; one of his brothers was
James Bentham the historian of Ely and another,
Edward Bentham, of Oxford, author of <i>Funebres
Orationes</i> and other works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph Bentham was free of the Stationers' Company
and Carter, the historian of Cambridge, refers
to him as "allowed by all Judges to be as great a
Proficient in the Mystery as any in <i>England</i>; which
the <i>Cambridge</i> Common Prayer Books and Bibles
... printed by him, will sufficiently evince."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Before Bentham's appointment, steps had already
been taken by the university to revive the business
of printing and selling bibles. Thus, in December,
1740, the Curators agreed to print small bibles
(9000) price 2<i>s</i> and 1000 on large paper at 2<i>s</i> 6<i>d</i>,
and six months later 11,000 small nonpareil bibles
and 1000 on large paper.</p>

<p>The services of Charles Bathurst, of London, were
secured as agent and from 1738 to 1744 he was
engaged in "buying, procuring, and expediting
Paper, Types, Servants, and other necessaries."</p>

<p class="b1">Bathurst's memorandum of 1751, though an
<i>ex parte</i> statement, throws an interesting light on
printing conditions at Cambridge:</p>

<p class="pbq">The Insolvency (he writes) of the University's late
Lessees for Bibles and the wishes and power of the King's
Printer considered, it was then a prevailing opinion, that
no advantage could well be made by printing Bibles and
Com. Prayers: therefore the Syndics were very diffident
and cautious in undertaking other Impressions<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">However, having previously passed a resolution
that Bentham was to sell no bibles without authority
from one of themselves, the Syndics in March, 174<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>,
covenanted with Bathurst that he should be the sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
selling agent for all books printed at Cambridge. Several
editions of the bible and prayer-book were put in
hand and subsequently reprinted, "but not near so
fast as they were sold." Bathurst grew impatient: "If
two presses will not do," he wrote to the Vice-Chancellor,
"[I hope that] three shall [be] employ'd in it:
for truly the jests People make here of the negligence
of our Advantage and Honour are very irksome."
The university, on the other hand, found itself unable
to make the necessary outlay of money for paper.
Bathurst had, according to his own account, spent considerable
sums in the purchase of type and had made
a six weeks' voyage to Holland in 1747 to procure
a good stock of paper. One parcel was duly received
by Bentham at Cambridge, but by the time that the
second consignment arrived, a new Vice-Chancellor
(Dr Parris, Master of Sidney Sussex College) had
taken office and the paper was promptly returned.</p>

<p class="pbq">I have returned your paper again (wrote the Vice-Chancellor)
which yet I would not have done, if we had
either wanted it, or had money left to have paid for it....
The Welsh Bible is paid for within a trifle: works of
authors bring in but a trifle: our chief dependance must
be on what our books in your hands produce.... I am
reduced to y<sup>e</sup> necessity of either returning your paper,
or, what is still worse, putting an intire stop to y<sup>e</sup> press<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A fresh arrangement was therefore proposed by
which Bathurst should pay ready money for books
printed and the university should not be required to
advance money to carry on the business.</p>

<p>Another source of trouble both to the Press and
to Bathurst during this period was a second attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
made by Baskett, the king's printer, upon the rights
of the university.</p>

<p>In 1741 the Syndics had printed for Bathurst an
<i>Abridgement of the Laws of Excise</i>, and on its publication
Baskett obtained an injunction to stop its
sale. Litigation dragged on until 1758, when the
Court of King's Bench decided in favour of the
university, declaring that it was entrusted with
"a concurrent Authority to print Acts of Parliament
and Abridgements by letters patent of
K. Hen. VIII and K. Charles I."</p>

<p>Dyer says of Bentham that "he was not eager
after money in the way of business, but rather ambitious
of printing Works that would do him credit.
He had a great taste for Gardening and a turn for
humour. He was an amiable man, as all the Benthams
were; and was the only Bentham of the family
that was not in orders. There were six brothers, who
all used to assemble at the Prebendal-house in Ely
at Christmas."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Joseph was an alderman of Cambridge
and lived in a house adjoining the Press in
Silver Street, the whole group of buildings forming
"a sort of Quadrangle or Square." This house had
belonged to Matthew Stokes, Registrary from 1558
to 1591, and Cole refers to the arms ("carved very
handsomely and very large") over the chimneypiece
in the parlour<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the books printed by Bentham the most sumptuous
is <i>The History of Ely Cathedral</i> by his brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
James Bentham, a large volume illustrated with many
engravings and published in 1765.</p>

<p>Other illustrated works of some interest are Zachary
Grey's edition of Samuel Butler's <i>Hudibras</i> (1774)
with a "set of new cuts" by Hogarth and <i>Cantabrigia
Depicta</i> (1763)<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. There may also be noted a Latin
version of Pope's <i>Ode on St Cecilia's Day</i> and a
succession of Seatonian prize poems by Christopher
Smart; a volume of <i>Odes</i> (1756) by William
Mason; Roger Long's <i>Astronomy</i> (1744); Robert
Masters's <i>History of the College of Corpus Christi</i>
(1752); a Latin version (anonymously published)
of Gray's <i>Elegy</i> by Christopher Anstey and W. H.
Roberts, Provost of Eton: and many editions of the
classics, including Squire's <i>Plutarch de Iside et Osiride</i>
(1744), Taylor's <i>Demosthenes</i> (various years) and
Richard Hurd's <i>Horace</i> (1757).</p>

<p>In 1715, when James Gibbs presented his design
for "the Publick Building at Cambridge," his plans
included provision for the printing-house above the
Registrary's office in the southern wing; and it has
been therefore inferred that the printing-house in
Silver Street was not adequate to the needs of the
university<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Only a portion of Gibbs's scheme (the
Senate House) was carried out and in 1762 the
Syndics of the Press, seeking fresh accommodation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
purchased a house, called <i>The White Lion</i>, which
probably stood on the south side of Silver Street,
facing the old Press. This was the first step taken in
the acquisition of the present site.</p>

<p class="p2 b1">Bentham continued in office until 1766 and well
maintained the typographical reputation of the Press,
but a more famous name is that of John Baskerville.
Originally a writing-master at Birmingham where,
from 1733 to 1737, he was teaching at a school in
the Bull Ring, he afterwards took up, with great
success, the trade of japanning and in 1750 began
his experiments in type-founding. He set his mind
to the improvement of type, press, paper, and
method of printing:</p>

<p class="pbq">It is not my desire (he wrote in the preface to his
<i>Milton</i>, 1757) to print many books, but such only as
are books of Consequence, and which the public may be
pleased to see in an elegant dress, and to purchase at
such a price as will repay the extraordinary care and
expense that must necessarily be bestowed upon them....
If this performance shall appear to persons of judgment
and penetration in the Paper, Letter, Ink, and Workmanship
to excel; I hope their approbation may contribute
to procure for me what would indeed be the
extent of my Ambition, a power to print an Octavo
Common-Prayer Book, and a Folio Bible.</p>

<p class="p1">This ambition was fulfilled by Baskerville's getting
into touch with the university. In 1757 he sent a
specimen of type to a friend at Cambridge, explaining
that</p>

<p class="pbqn">the size is calculated for people who begin to want
Spectacles but are ashamed to use them at Church.... If
I find favour with the University, &amp; they give me a
Grant to print an Edition of a prayer book according to
the specimen I would ... send to Cambridge two presses,
Workmen &amp; all other requisites, but should be glad to
take the chance of the Edition to my self, &amp; make the
University such Considerations as they should think fit
to prescribe.... My highest Ambition is to print a folio
Bible, with the same letter of the inclosed Specimen.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The application was successful and on 15 December,
1758, an agreement was made with the university
by which Baskerville was to have leave to print
a folio bible and two octavo common-prayer books,
and on the following day Baskerville was duly elected
to be "one of the Stationers &amp; Printers" of the university
for ten years, securities for £500 each being
given by Baskerville himself and by John Eaves, a
toymaker of Birmingham.</p>

<p class="b1">The conditions imposed upon the new printer were
strict: he was to print in Cambridge only such books
as the Syndics gave him leave to print; on the title-page
of no other book was he to describe himself as
Printer to the University; inspectors appointed by
the Syndics were to have free access to his printing-office;
and Baskerville was to pay the university £20
for every 1000 of the 8vo common-prayer. On
31 May, 1759, Baskerville wrote from Birmingham
to the Vice-Chancellor:</p>

<p class="pbq">Sir,</p>

<p class="pbq2">I have at last sent everything requisite to begin
the Prayer Book at Cambridge. The Bearer M<sup>r</sup> Tho.
Warren is my Deputy in conducting the whole. I have
ordered him to inform you of every step he takes, and
to desire you would appoint a person to tell out the
number of sheets before they go to press and again before
they are packed up for Birmingham. M<sup>r</sup> Bentham will
inform you how many sheets per 1000 are allowed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wast. I have attempted several ornaments, but none of
them please me so well as the specimen; which I hope will
be approved by you and the Gentlemen of the Syndick.
I propose printing off 2000 the first impression, but only
1000 of the State holidays &amp;c which the patentee has
left out. The paper is very good and stands me in 27 or
28 shillings the Ream.</p>

<p class="pbq">I am taking great pains, in order to produce a striking
title-page &amp; specimen of the Bible which I hope will be
ready in about six weeks. The importance of the work
demands all my attention; not only for my own (eternal)
reputation; but (I hope) also to convince the world, that
the University in the honour done me has not intirely
misplaced their Favours.</p>

<p class="pbq">You will please to accept &amp; give my most respectful
duty to the University, particularly to the Gentlemen of
the Syndick. I should be very happy if I could make an
Interest to a few Gent<sup>n</sup>. to whom the work would not be
disagreeable, to survey the sheets, after my people had
corrected them as accurately as they are able, that I
might, if possible, be free from every error of the press;
for which I would gladly make suitable acknowledgements.
I procured a sealed copy of the Common prayer
with much trouble and expense from the Cathedral of
Litchfield, but found it the most inaccurate and ill printed
book I ever saw: so that I returned it with thanks<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Evidently neither the university nor Bentham was
willing to give Baskerville a free hand. Bentham
was naturally jealous of his own position and the
Syndics' previous experience of leases granted to
outside printers had been unfortunate. Reed's criticism
is therefore a little too harsh: "This learned
body," he writes, "appear to have been influenced
in the transaction more by a wish to fill their own
coffers than by a desire to promote the interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the Art; and the heavy premiums exacted from
Baskerville for the privilege thus accorded effectually
deprived him of any advantage whatever in the undertaking."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p class="p1 b1">By a further agreement of 3 July, 1761, Baskerville
undertook to pay £12 10<i>s</i> 0<i>d</i> per 1000 for the 4000
copies to be printed of the 12 mo Common Prayer
and in a letter of 2 November, 1762, he wrote in a
dismal strain to Horace Walpole:</p>

<p class="pbq">The University of Cambridge have given me a Grant
to print there 8vo. &amp; 12mo. Common prayer Books;
but under such Shackles as greatly hurt me. I pay them
for the former twenty, &amp; for the latter twelve pound ten
shillings the thousand, &amp; to the Stationers Company
thirty two pound for their permission to print one Edition
of the Psalms in Metre to the small prayer book: add to
this the great Expence of double and treble Carriage, &amp;
the inconvenience of a Printing House an hundred Miles
off. All this Summer I have had nothing to print at
Home. My folio Bible is pretty far advanced at Cambridge,
which will cost me near £2000 all hired at 5 p
Cent. If this does not sell, I shall be obliged to sacrifice
a small Patrimony which brings me in [£74] a Year to
this Business of printing; which I am heartily tired of
&amp; repent I ever attempted. It is surely a particular
hardship that I should not get Bread in my own Country
(and it is too late to go abroad) after having acquired the
Reputation of excelling in the most useful Art known to
Mankind; while every one who excels as a Player, Fidler,
Dancer &amp;c not only lives in Affluence but has it [in]
their power to save a Fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">However, four prayer-books (two with long lines
and two in double column) were produced by Baskerville
in 1760 and of these two were reprinted in
the following year; the folio bible appeared in 1763.</p>

<p>In spite of their failure from the commercial point
of view, Baskerville's prayer-books and bible were
recognised as something finer than, or at any rate
as something different in kind from, what had been
produced before. Dibdin called the bible "one of
the most beautifully printed books in the world" and
called special attention to the title-page as having "all
the power and brilliancy of copper-plate." The contrast,
too, between the dignified design of Baskerville's
title-pages and the conventionally crowded title-page
of the period has also been duly emphasised<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Baskerville's type has been
criticised as being modelled too closely upon his own
mastery of penmanship&mdash;the upstrokes very thin, the
downstrokes very thick, the serifs very fine<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. Controversy
apart, Baskerville's is without doubt the most
distinguished typographical work associated with the
University Press in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Depressed by the financial failure of his bible, Baskerville
printed no more in Cambridge after 1763<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>;
when he died twelve years later, a French society
bought his types and used them for an edition of Voltaire
and other works.</p>

<p class="p2 b1">Bentham continued to hold the office of printer
until 1766. On 13 December of that year he resigned
and John Archdeacon, an Irishman, was elected in
his place, his salary being fixed two years later at £140<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a year. Archdeacon had been appointed Inspector
of the Press two months before, and, as appears from
certain passages in Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, had
been associated with a scheme by which Bowyer had
contemplated taking over the management of the
University Press:</p>

<p class="pbq">In consequence (writes Nichols) of overtures from a
few respectable friends at Cambridge, M<sup>r</sup> Bowyer had
some inclination, towards the latter end of 1765, to have
undertaken the management of the University Press,
by purchasing a lease and their exclusive privileges, by
which for several years they had cleared a considerable
sum. To accomplish this he took a journey to Cambridge;
and afterwards sent the Compiler of these Anecdotes to
negotiate with the Vice-Chancellor. The treaty was fruitless;
but he did not much regret the disappointment.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Evidently it was intended that Archdeacon should
be the printer under Bowyer's management, since
Nichols wrote to Bowyer in September, 1765:</p>

<p class="pbq">I write to you now from the house of M<sup>r</sup> Labutte<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>,
with whom I have dined, and who has most obligingly
shewn me all in his power. M<sup>r</sup> Archdeacon is not at
home. I have opened to M<sup>r</sup> Labutte my plan, who is of
opinion something may be done. I have talked also
with a <i>Compositor</i>, who is sensible, and who now works
in the house. <i>Six hundred</i> a year I believe may carry
it. They <i>talk</i> of <i>ten</i> having been <i>offered</i>. For 7 years last
past the University have <i>cleared one-thousand-three-hundred
pounds</i> annually; besides farming the <i>Almanack</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
(200 l. more). This might at least be <i>doubled by opening
the trade</i> in new channels. If any bookseller of reputation
would enter into a scheme with you, <i>an immense
fortune would certainly be raised</i>....</p>

<p class="p1 b1">and Bowyer, in his reply, wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq">M<sup>r</sup> Archdeacon, as you observe, must be a leading
person, and there is some delicacy necessary to be shewn
to him.</p>

<p class="p1">This proposal, however, came to nothing, and no
university documents relating to it have been preserved.</p>

<p>From the business point of view, the printing and
selling of bibles and prayer-books no doubt continued
to be the most important branch of Archdeacon's
activities. In a collection of agents' accounts
for the years 1766 and 1767 the well-known names
of Edward Dilly, John Rivington, James Waugh,
T. and J. Merrill appear. One of these accounts,
made out in Archdeacon's own hand<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, is reproduced
here as showing the numbers and prices of
bibles supplied to Rivington during the period of
six months and also the way in which the accounts
were examined and approved by the Syndics of the
Press.</p>

<p>In the year following that of Archdeacon's appointment
a contract, similar to those of 1706 and
1727, was made with the Stationers' Company by
which the Stationers, in return for an annual payment
of £500, were granted the right of printing a
large number of books (including school editions of
classical authors, Lily's Grammar, Almanacks, Gradus
ad Parnassum, Horn Book prints and Psalters)
for the term of 21 years<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Later, in 1775, an Act of Parliament secured to
the universities the perpetual copyright of all schoolbooks
bequeathed to them; but in the same year it
was ruled in the Court of Common Pleas that the
right of printing almanacks was a common law right
over which the Crown had no control, and the
Stationers' Company thereupon discontinued their
payments to the universities.</p>

<p class="b1">However, in 1781 a new almanack duty act granted
to each university the sum of £500 per annum as
compensation. At Cambridge this sum was placed at
the disposal of the Syndics of the Press for the publication
of works of learning by the following grace
of 11 June, 1782:</p>

<p class="pbq">Cum ad graves librorum imprimendorum sumptus
sublevandos omnigenaeque adeo eruditionis studium
promovendum, annuo quingentarum librarum reditu
Academiam nuper auxerit munificentia publica; ne aut
nostra negligentia deflorescat tantus publice habitus literis
honos, aut in alios usus transferatur quod doctrinae amplificandae
sacrum esse oporteat; placeat vobis ut Typographici
Preli Curatores in hac etiam parte Syndici vestri
constituantur, atque ut quingentae quotannis librae, si
ipsis necessarium videatur, vel in novas veterum scriptorum
editiones apparandas, vel in recentiorum opera
divulganda insumendae iis hoc nomine e Communi Cista
erogentur....</p>

<p class="p1">Since the abolition of the paper duty and the consequent
loss to the university of the advantage of
drawback, this grant constitutes the single subsidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
which the Syndics of the Press receive from an outside
source.</p>

<p>About this time the competency of the Syndics was
called into question. It was alleged, for instance,
that one Syndic did not know the difference between
<i>collating</i> and <i>collecting</i> <span class="smcap">MSS</span>; a more serious charge
was that the warehouse in Silver Street, acquired in
1672, was damp and that great injury had been done
to the stock of sheets kept there. In reply, Dr Plumptre
asserted that the damage done amounted only to
£20. Archdeacon remained in office till the year of
his death, 1795; in 1793 John Burges was elected printer
and acted in partnership with him for two years.</p>

<p>Of the books printed in the last thirty years of the
eighteenth century one of the most ambitious was
Thomas Kipling's facsimile edition, in two folio
volumes, of the <i>Codex Bezae</i> (1793), "the very
crown of the Cambridge Press." Kipling was the
leader of the prosecution of William Freind, author
of <i>Peace and Union recommended to the associated
bodies of Republicans and Anti-Republicans</i> (2nd ed.
1793), and refused to allow Gilbert Wakefield's <i>Silva
Critica</i> to be printed at the Press on account of the
author's unorthodoxy<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>Gray's <i>Commemoration Ode</i>, set to music by Dr Randal,
was printed in 1769<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; Samuel Ogden's <i>Sermons
on the Efficacy of Prayer and Intercession</i> (Boswell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
favourite reading during his tour to the Hebrides)
were published in 1770 and were followed by other
volumes of sermons in 1777; the Parker <span class="smcap">MSS</span> were
catalogued by James Nasmith and published in 1777,
the Baker collection by Robert Masters in 1784;
Thomas Martyn, Professor of Botany, published a
<i>Catalogus Horti Botanici</i> in 1771 and <i>Elements of
Natural History</i> in 1775; the second edition of John
Wesley's <i>Duty and Advantage of early rising</i> was
printed in 1785 and the changing spirit of the age
is reflected in a sermon of 1788 entitled <i>Slavery inconsistent
with the Spirit of Christianity</i> and a <i>Sermon
on Duelling</i>, by Thomas Jones (1792).</p>

<p>The beginnings of the study of modern languages
in Cambridge are seen in La Butte's <i>French Grammar</i>
(2nd ed. 1790) and in various editions of Tasso and
other Italian authors by Agostino Isola, a teacher
who, at different times, could reckon Thomas Gray,
William Pitt, and William Wordsworth among his
pupils<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1"><i>Ten Minutes' Advice to Freshmen</i> by A Questionist,
printed by Archdeacon for J. Deighton in 1785,
deserves a few lines of quotation:</p>

<p class="pbq">It is not reckoned fashionable to go to <i>St Mary's</i> on a
Sunday.&mdash;But I know no harm in going, nor that it is
any reproach to a man's understanding to be seen publickly
in the same place with the most dignified and
respectable persons of the University.&mdash;To say nothing
about the regularity of the thing, and its being approved
of by people whose good opinion you may be desirous to
obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">It is neither my business nor my inclination to prose
to you upon the usefulness of Mathematical learning&mdash;it
is sufficient that it has its uses....</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Of the standard of mathematical printing at this period
a circumstantial complaint is preserved by Nichols in
a letter from William Ludlam, author of <i>Rudiments
of Mathematics</i> (2nd ed. 1787) and other works<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>:</p>

<p class="pbq">For my own part, I am sometimes forced to make
types, which are commonly brass, of which I here send
you a specimen (± a ± b ± c). It is called plus-minus ±.
I printed my first tracts at Cambridge when Archdeacon
(not Bentham) was their printer. I was very sick of it;
the University meanly provided with mathematical types
insomuch that they used daggers turned sideways for
<i>plus's</i>. They were sunk into arrant traders, even to printing
hand-bills, quack-bills, &amp;c., which they then for the
first time permitted for Archdeacon's profit. As to tablework
of which I had a deal, they knew nothing of it; and
many a brass rule was I forced to make myself.... I complained
of this to Mr Bowyer, and would have had him
print my essay on Hadley's quadrant<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>; but he was too
full of more important work. I remember I told him I
had marked all Archdeacon's damaged letters; which
were not a few, especially in the italic. To which the old
gentleman replied 'I don't like you the better for that.'</p>

<p class="p1">One of the last books printed by the Archdeacon-Burges
partnership was a translation of a Latin poem,
<i>The Immortality of the Soul</i>, by Isaac Hawkins Browne
who, "one of the first wits of this country," according
to Johnson, "got into Parliament, and never opened
his mouth."</p>

<p>John Burges continued as sole printer after the
death of Archdeacon in 1795. Two large dictionaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
were, amongst other works, printed during his
term of office: Ladvocat's <i>Historical and Biographical
Dictionary</i> (1800-1801) and Hoogeveen's <i>Dictionarium
Analogicum</i> (1800); academical works of reference,
such as <i>Cambridge University Calendar</i> (1796)
and the <i>Graduati Cantabrigienses</i> (1800), also begin
to appear; the <i>Calendar</i>, however, was not regularly
printed at the Press until 1826, and it is only since
1914 that the Syndics have been responsible for its
publication<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there may be noted Relhan's <i>Flora Cantabrigiensis</i>
(2nd ed. 1802) and Harraden's <i>Picturesque
Views of Cambridge</i> (1800) containing 24 views
from original drawings by Richard Harraden, a
London artist who came to Cambridge in 1798.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY</p>

<p class="pn p2">The immediate official successor of Burges as
university printer was John Deighton, elected
on 28 April, 1802; he, however, held office only till
11 December of the same year and seems to have
served the Press as publishing agent rather than as
printer. Thus in 1803 he, with Francis Hodson of
Cambridge and Richard Newcomb of Stamford,
undertook to purchase the whole stock of royal
octavo bibles belonging to the university (amounting
to 5627 copies in all) for the sum of £2323 10<i>s</i>.</p>

<p>Deighton had begun business in Cambridge about
1777 and removed to London in 1786; in 1795 he
appears to have returned to Cambridge, where he established
the bookselling firm that has since become
Deighton, Bell and Co.</p>

<p>About this time the Syndics seem to have taken
counsel of, or at any rate to have compared notes
with, the Oxford University Press; a rough notebook,
kept by Isaac Milner, one of the most active
of the Cambridge Syndics, contains various memoranda
concerning the Oxford method of management.
Milner seems particularly to have discussed
with Mr Dawson, of the Clarendon Press, the proper
percentage of profit on the printing and selling of
bibles. One of Milner's notes is reproduced here as
being of interest not only in the history of Cambridge
printing, but also in the history of business;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it should be added that there is a note appended to
the calculation explaining that "the 25 per cent.,
it is supposed, will nearly leave the proposed profit
of £10 per cent. and pay all the wear and tear and
salary of superintendence."</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill153" id="ill153">i153</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Richard Watts, the printer elected at Cambridge
to succeed John Deighton in December, 1802, also
appears to have had previous experience in Oxford,
where he had conducted, and had a share in, a paper
under Dr Manor, called the <i>Oxford Mercury</i>, in opposition
to Dr Jackson's <i>Oxford Journal</i>. Immediately
before his election he seems to have been agent
for Mr Hamilton, a printer of Falcon Court, London.</p>

<p>A little more than a year after this appointment
Cambridge received another offer of a secret for the
process of stereotype printing. The inventor was the
third Earl Stanhope, a remarkable man who, besides
being prominent in political life, was a Fellow of
the Royal Society, the author of <i>Principles of Electricity</i>,
and the inventor of many devices including
a microscopic lens, a new kind of cement, a calculating
machine, an artificial tile for keeping out
rain, a cure for wounds made in trees, an instrument
for performing logical operations, and several improvements
in the art of printing. Of these last the
most important were the Stanhope press and an improved
process of stereotyping: the Stanhope press
was made of iron instead of wood and an ingenious
mechanism made it possible to print a sheet twice
as large as on the old wooden presses; the university
bought two of these new presses, which are still in
use at the present day.</p>

<p>The offer of the stereotype secret came to the
university from Andrew Wilson, the London printer
employed by Earl Stanhope. By a preliminary agreement
of 20 April, 1804, Wilson was to receive for
the space of 14 years one-third of the savings resulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from the employment of the stereotype process
and was to act, in conjunction with Watts, as
agent for the Syndics' bibles and prayer-books. The
savings were to be calculated by arbitrators appointed
by the respective parties.</p>

<p class="b1">This not very business-like arrangement naturally
led to a dispute before long. As early as October,
1805, Milner seems to have had misgivings both
about the scheme and about Wilson's competency,
as the following entries in his notebook show:</p>

<p class="pbq">Qy whether Wilson's declaration of 30,000 profits in
8 years be not a proof want of judgm<sup>t</sup>.</p>

<p class="pbq">Qy whether Wilson be not an advent<sup>r</sup>&mdash;without judgment.</p>

<p class="pbq">Hints to new Vice-C<sup>r</sup>.</p>

<p class="pbq">1. The system of talking <i>before</i> them viz. Watts and
Wilson.</p>

<p class="pbq">The absolute necessity of others being informed in the
stereotype art.</p>

<p class="pbq">Watts talks of going to London again by Wilson's
directions to see what chases and things he wants&mdash;and
when I say he should not leave them, he says, Oh, there
is no more in leaving them now than when he was ill&mdash;they
are to be trusted.</p>

<p class="pbq">Qy&mdash;Quid cogitant ille and Wilson.</p>

<p class="pbq">Qy <i>x</i> to agree with Oxf<sup>d</sup>? as a Stereotyper?</p>

<p class="p1">The supposition contained in the last cryptic note
was well justified, as Wilson had in March, 1805,
proposed to the Clarendon Press "to put the University
in possession of the Art of Stereotype Printing";
later in the same year the Delegates, having
resolved that "the University of Cambridge being in
possession of the Art, it seems not only expedient,
but necessary, that Oxford should be possess'd of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
same advantages," entered into an agreement by which
Wilson was to instruct their representatives in the
stereotype processes for the sum of £4000<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1806 Wilson claimed that, as the introduction
of stereotyping had enabled the Syndics to convert
a warehouse into a printing-office for the sum of
£1500 instead of building a new one at a cost of
£4500, he was entitled by the agreement to his share
of the saving of £3000 thus effected.</p>

<p>On 6 March, 1807, the university agreed to pay
Wilson the sum of £865 16<i>s</i> 9<i>d</i> for the composition
and two sets of plates of a bourgeois testament,
a brevier testament and a nonpareil Welsh
testament<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>; it being provided that the university
should make for Wilson (from type supplied by himself)
so many perfect plates towards octavo editions
of Ainsworth's Dictionary and Johnson's Dictionary
as should amount in value to the aggregate of Wilson's
bill. Later in the same year the university definitely
acquired the stereotype secret by a further agreement:
£2000 was to be paid immediately, £1000
which had been previously advanced to Wilson was
to become his property, and further sums were to be
paid in accordance with the amount of the sales of
bibles, testaments and prayer-books<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p class="b1">The following extracts, describing the outline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the stereotype process, are taken from Milner's notebook:</p>

<p class="pbq">1. The pages as they come from the composers have
been first well cleansed with a solution of American
Potash&mdash;14 lb in 3 buckets of water.</p>

<p class="pbq">2. They must then be gently dried by the fire and then
<i>cool</i> and a little oil of Turpentine is put on a plate with 2
parts sweet oil.... This mixture gets thick by time: The
plate is then well done over with a little of this mixture
by one of the small soft brushes like a painter's brush....</p>

<p class="pbq">3. Then a <i>copper measure</i> of the powdered calcined
gypsum is taken&mdash;viz. about ½ or ¾ pint and the same
quantity of soft water and they are put into a copper
vessel and shaken exceedingly well together: and then
the mixture is to be poured upon the types, there being
first placed upon them an iron frame to form an Edge to
sustain the fluid Gypsum and water.</p>

<p class="pbq">4. Immediately, and without the least loss of time the
short square brushes are now to be taken and you
must work the Air out quickly with them and continue
working till the gypsum is too fixed to allow of more
working.</p>

<p class="pbq">5. When so fixed that you can easily make an impression,
that is, while the Plaster is softish, take off the
upper frame and scrape clean all the elevated plaster. It
will rise again above the level by and by; scrape again&mdash;and
lastly as soon as it is so fixed that it is not easy to
make a mark with y<sup>r</sup> nail, then lay it carefully upon a <i>soft
frame</i> (covered with a sort of cloth) and then take a piece
of wood that nearly fits the cake, and gently thrust it so
as to make it quit the frame; and then dress it with a
knife and lay it between two pieces of marble to keep
it from warping.</p>

<p class="pbq">6. The types must now be cleaned by picking out any
bits of gypsum left in the Interstices ... and lastly they
must be brushed; and then done over again for a new
mold.</p>

<p class="pbq"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">7. The artist, Mr Austen, Engraver can dress and
cure any little imperfection in the plates when cast.</p>

<p class="pbq">8. The Gypsum requires about 2 hours for calcination;
and is known to be right when you break the pieces,
and see them moulded quite thro'&mdash;Matter of Experience.</p>

<p class="pbq">9. The Gypsum should be broken with small bits
about 2 ounces each.</p>

<p class="pbq">10. and when calcined they are to be ground on a
Stone....</p>

<p class="pbq">11. When the moulds are made, and placed between
the marbles ... they will be ready in 2 or 3 hours for
baking....</p>

<p class="pbq">12. They are to be baked being placed upright on
stands like those for toasted bread&mdash;raised a little from
the bottom of the furnace&mdash;About 2 hours or 2½hours
will take the moulds....</p>


<p class="pbq center">Casting</p>

<p class="pbq">The metal is precisely the Type metal. The Pots must
be made quite as hot as the metal&mdash;or rather more&mdash;.
Then the floating plate must be placed in the frame&mdash;and
the cake or mould directly upon it with its face downwards:
Then place upon the top the cover of the frame,
and screw it down: and dip the whole in metal melted so
that a match will light at it.&mdash;The melted metal will run
in at those places made in the mould by the bits of brass&mdash;till
all be full&mdash;and then remove the whole to be cooled
on a tile in water with lime upon it&mdash;and as it cools and
shrinks, supply with fresh melted metal.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The acquisition of this secret did not end the disputes
with Wilson; the university in 1811 protested
against payment of the bill referred to in the agreement
of March, 1807, on the ground that Wilson
had not supplied them with the type for Ainsworth's
and Johnson's Dictionaries and that they were so prevented
from selling the plates to him. No documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have been preserved to show how the case ended, but
the following hypothetical case on which the university
invited the opinion of counsel about this time
may be quoted in conclusion:</p>

<p class="pbq">Whether supposing A.B. to be acquainted with the
secret mode of making stereotype plates, and supposing
C.D. to know the mode now in general use, and whereas
it is conceived that the secret is now no secret. Supposing
A.B. to inquire of C.D. his (C.D.'s) mode of
making the plates, and by his answers it appeared that
he (C.D.) was acquainted with all the peculiarities of
the secret, would A.B. be justified in telling C.D. that
such was the secret?</p>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile, the Press buildings were growing. On
the site of the White Lion Inn, bought in 1762, a
warehouse had been built in 1786 and on 20 April,
1804, the Syndics instructed Mr Watts, with the
assistance of Mr Humphreys, to "prepare a plan
for altering the Warehouse into a Printing office."
This building was described by Dyer, writing in
1809, as "a commodious brick building, situated
in Silver Street, with a stereotype foundry adjoining"
and, as has been already seen, it was claimed that
this economical conversion was made possible by the
introduction of stereotype printing.</p>

<p>The Syndics' relations with their printer at this
time were not altogether happy. In 1808 two of the
Syndics (Dr Milner and Mr Wood) were appointed
to examine the Press accounts, since it was alleged
that, in contrast to the average annual profit of £1500
for a number of years before 1802, Watts had shown
no profit at all for five years. These charges were set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
forth in a pamphlet entitled <i>Facts and Observations
relative to the state of the University Press</i>, to which
Watts wrote a <i>Reply</i>. Watts resigned as soon as the
enquiry was instituted and, when the examination of
the accounts was completed in the next year, it was
decided to elect a new printer. Apart from the various
stereotype editions of the bible and prayer-book no
books of great importance seem to have been printed
by Watts.</p>

<p>His successor, John Smith, was elected in 1809
and held the office of printer for 26 years.</p>

<p class="b1">It was during this period that the University Press
began to assume its present appearance<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. By 1820
the existing buildings had become quite inadequate
to the growing business of the Press and the Syndics
recommended the university to purchase Mr James
Nutter's estate in Silver Street for the sum of £5060.
The following grace was accordingly passed by the
Senate on 24 January, 1821:</p>

<p class="pbq">Quum in Typographeo vestro, ex angustiis loci, multa
detrimenta atque incommoda subinde exoriri soleant;
quumque, in remedium mali istius, Preli Typographici
Curatores pactionem inierint cum Domino Nutter, ut
facultate a vobis impetrata, quasdam domos illius quinque
mille et sexaginta librarum pretio redimerunt: Placeat
Vobis, ut pactio ista rata ac firma habeatur, atque ut
summa praedicta e cista communi, usibus istis destinanda,
erogetur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The property thus acquired was on the site of the
ancient inn known as The Cardinal's Cap. Its boundaries
are marked on the plan and in 1824,
the Syndics of the Press, having taken the advice
of an "eminent London Printer" (Mr Hansard),
recommended that, as the existing buildings were
"so dilapidated and so inadequate to the effectual
conducting of the business," immediate steps should
be taken towards extension. In the next year plans
by James Walter for a new printing-house on the
west side of the quadrangle and a printer's house in
Mill Lane were approved by the Senate. These
buildings were completed in January, 1827, the fitting
of them being superintended by Thomas Hansard<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p>A more famous addition to the Press buildings is
that associated with the name of William Pitt.</p>

<p class="b1">On 25 May, 1824, the following letter was addressed
to the Vice-Chancellor (John Lamb, Master
of Corpus Christi College) by the Marquess Camden,
chairman of the London Pitt Club Committee:</p>

<p class="pbq">Sir,</p>

<p class="pbq2">I have the Honor to inform you that I am just returned
from a Meeting of the Committee appointed to
consider of the disposal of the surplus of Money subscribed,
many years ago, for the Erection of a Statue to
the memory of M<sup>r</sup> Pitt.</p>

<p class="pbq">I am, now, authorized by that Committee to state to
you, Sir, that which I had the Honor of personally communicating
to you at Cambridge: 'the disposition of that
Committee to recommend to a general Meeting of Subscribers
to the Fund above-mentioned the Disposal of a
considerable Sum of Money for the Erection of an handsome
Building connected with the University Press at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Cambridge;' but, as it will be necessary to state to the
general Meeting how far the University is disposed to
find and provide a proper Scite for the erecting such
Building, near or opposite to Pembroke College, I now
trouble you on that subject, and I request you will have
the goodness to inform me how far I may be authorized
to inform the General Meeting of the Disposition of the
University to find and provide a proper Scite as above-mentioned
for the erecting of an handsome Building,
which the Committee is desirous should be erected on
such a scale as to be a distinguished Ornament to the
University, and tend to perpetuate the Name and Memory
of M<sup>r</sup> Pitt.</p>

<p class="pn30 reduct">I have the Honor to remain, Sir,</p>
<p class="pn35 reduct">Your most obedient humble Servant,</p>
<p class="pn60 reduct"><span class="smcap">Camden</span>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">A favourable reply having, no doubt, been received
from the university, the Committee, at a meeting
held at the Thatched House Tavern on 18 June,
1824, unanimously passed the following resolution:</p>

<p class="pbq">That the surplus of the Fund, after defraying the
Expense of the Statue in Hanover-Square, as resolved
at the former meeting on the 11<sup>th</sup> instant, be applied to
the Erection of a handsome and appropriate Building at
Cambridge, connected with the University Press; such
to bear the name of M<sup>r</sup> Pitt. That the Committee be
desired to take the necessary steps for carrying into
execution this Resolution.</p>

<p class="p1">The university, on its part, appointed a Syndicate
with authority to expend the sum of £8000 in purchasing
"houses or leases of houses for the purpose
of making exchanges with the Proprietors of the
houses between Silver Street and Mill Lane fronting
towards Trumpington Street."</p>

<p class="b1">After some years of delay the Committee approved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the designs submitted by Edmund Blore, who came
to Cambridge with a letter of introduction from the
Marquess Camden in 1829. In this letter the desire
of the Committee for an imposing central chamber
and staircase is evident:</p>

<p class="pbq">It is necessary to premise, that the Committee is
desirous that an handsome Room should be included in
the Design, together with a staircase leading to it, but
that the Committee would be most desirous any Accommodation
could be given to the Press in the Building to
be erected which did not interfere with those parts which
they think should be ornamented.</p>

<p class="p1">Subsequently the university obtained the whole
frontage between Mill Lane and Silver Street&mdash;a
larger site than that on which Blore's original design
had been based. Furthermore, the Pitt statue in Hanover
Square cost more than had been anticipated.
The Pitt Memorial Committee, therefore, undertook
to erect the main building in Trumpington Street at
a cost of £9000, while the university authorised an
expenditure of not more than £2000 upon the buildings
(also designed by Blore) which form the north
side of the Press quadrangle.</p>

<p>The first stone of the Pitt Press building was laid
by the Marquess Camden on 18 October, 1831, and
the work was completed in about eighteen months,
the total cost being £10,711 8<i>s</i> 9<i>d</i>.</p>

<p class="b1">It consists of three floors with a square central
tower containing a lofty room designed for the Press
Syndicate, but now used as the Registry of the University.
As to the architectural style of the building,
comment may best be confined to the repetition
of Willis and Clark's laconic description: "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
style of the building is Late Perpendicular." Some
extracts from the account of the opening on 28 April,
1833, abridged from <i>The Cambridge Chronicle</i> (1 May,
1833), may also be given in conclusion:</p>

<p class="pbq">The Pitt Press having been completed, Tuesday last
was appointed for the Vice-Chancellor to receive the key
of the building from the Marquis Camden and a deputation
of the Pitt Committee.... Having arrived at the building
the Marquis Camden, accompanied by the members
of the Committee, proceeded into the grand entrance hall,
and having invited the Vice-Chancellor to the door, spoke
as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq">"Mr Vice-Chancellor and Gentlemen of the University
of Cambridge: The idea of connecting the name of
Mr Pitt with the Press of that University to which he
owed his education and so much of his fame, was met
by all parties with enthusiasm. The University have
displayed an activity and liberality in providing this magnificent
site which could only have been prompted by
an admiration for the character of Mr Pitt. The Committee,
animated by a personal respect and affection towards
their contemporary, have endeavoured to cause to
be erected on this site, such a building as might prove
an addition to the other great improvements already perfected
in this place and which, from its peculiar destination,
will unite the name of Mr Pitt with all those works
of religion, morality, and science, which will in future
emanate from it, and diffuse throughout the world the
connexion of his name with erudition and learning....</p>

<p class="pbq">Sir, you have caused this ceremony to be attended by
all the undergraduates as well as by the dignitaries of the
University. Let me call the peculiar attention of all to
this ceremony, and allow me to impress on the undergraduates
that we, Mr Pitt's contemporaries, have been
witnesses of his uniting the closest study with the utmost
cheerfulness, and, when not employed in solving the
most abstruse problems, he has engaged the admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of his friends and companions, by the liveliest sallies of
wit and imagination. Let his example stimulate you to
the greatest exertion during your residence in this place,
so well calculated to provide for your instruction in every
department of literature and science."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p class="p1 b1">The key was then presented to the Vice-Chancellor,
who grew eloquent in his reply:</p>

<p class="pbq">What more appropriate monument then could be
erected to the memory of Pitt than this building, the
chief purpose and object of which is to send forth to the
world the Word of God; and could he, with prophetic
eye, when residing in yon neighbouring college, whose
proudest boast is to number him among her sons&mdash;could
he have beheld such a structure, bearing his name, raised
for such a purpose, and erected by such friends, even his
own eloquence would have scarce sufficed to express the
feelings of his heart. My Lord, the edifice with which
you have adorned this University, and the illustrious
name it bears, will add a fresh stimulus to our exertions
in the dissemination of truth, the extension of science,
and the advancement of religious knowledge; and I
humbly trust that nothing will ever issue from these walls
but such works as may conduce to the furtherance of
these important objects....<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="p1">After which, the company, having printed off copies
of the inscription on the foundation-stone from a
press specially set up for the occasion, "went upstairs
into the Syndicate Room, where they partook of a
cold collation given by the Press Syndicate."</p>

<p class="p2">In the early part of his career, John Smith laboured
under the difficulties arising out of the "dilapidated
and inadequate" condition of the old Press buildings.
The chief source of business continued to be the
sale of bibles and prayer-books and agencies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
arranged with Rivingtons, Baldwin &amp; Co., and
other London booksellers.</p>

<p>Of the books printed by Smith the most notable
are the editions of classical authors for which the
"Great Porson Greek" type was used. This fine
fount had been cut under Porson's direction by Austin,
of London, with the assistance of Richard Watts and
was used for various editions of the Greek tragedians
by Blomfield, Monk, and Scholefield.</p>

<p>In 1824 the King expressed his gracious pleasure
that the newly discovered <span class="smcap">ms</span> of Milton should be
printed at the University Press and a new fount of
pica type (weighing 12 cwt.) was specially ordered
from Messrs Millar, of Edinburgh, for the purpose<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1827 the Syndics, having again taken counsel of
eminent London printers and booksellers (Charles
and John Rivington, Mawman, Baldwin, Hansard,
Gilbert), resolved upon the expediency of appointing
"a Superintendent of the concerns of the Press in
all its departments, immediately under the Vice-Chancellor
and General Syndicate," and, while no
charges were brought against the technical quality of
Smith's printing, there seems to have been a general
feeling that he was not adequate to the control of the
whole business. Smith's <i>Observations relating to the
Affairs of the Press</i> (16 March, 1829) throw an
interesting light on the difficulties with which he had
to contend. He begs to observe, for instance,</p>

<p class="pbqn">that many of the works brought to the Press are in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>most unprepared state possible ... the consequence is, that
when proof-sheets are sent to the respective Authors, the
work is much cut-up, and subject to continued Overrunnings
and Corrections.... The Authors, for the most
part being Gentlemen of the University engaged with
Pupils during Term-time, furnish their Copy in detail&mdash;loosely
written&mdash;and frequent suspensions of MS, which
necessarily occasions great delay and inconvenience....
The Gentlemen of the Press Syndicate must be aware
(tho' a London Printer cannot, unless he witnessed the
operation) that the Examination-Papers which of late
years have abundantly increased, must from their nature
have retarded all regular work in the Composing Room.
These papers could only be executed by Workmen competent
and accustomed to Mathematical and Greek Composition;
and my best Mathematical Compositors are
those who have been brought up and trained in our own
Office: London Workmen having in several instances
left the Office, rather than undertake the Composition
of such Works<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Smith also claims a development of the bible
business:</p>

<p class="pbq">I had the honour of being elected Printer at the close
of 1809&mdash;at that time the number of Presses employed
did not exceed eight: the number increased in 1812 and
1813 to thirteen. At this period, and on to 1815 and 17
increased and increasing Orders flowed in from the British
and Foreign Bible Society and also (through Messrs
Rivingtons) from the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge....</p>

<p class="pbq">The fact is, that from 1813 to 1815 the demand for
Bibles etc was such, that had the same quantity of work
to be executed been required to be finished in the manner
in which the same books are now printed, they would
not possibly have been done with the means the Press
then possessed&mdash;"Send up the Books in gatherings" (i.e.
divisions) was the repeated order of the Bible Society&mdash;"and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
we will spare you the trouble of booking off etc,
etc." Many thousand copies were thus supplied which
were never properly dried....</p>

<p class="p2">Finally, a statement is presented showing an average
annual profit of £3191 from 1809 to 1827.</p>

<p>The Syndics, however, adhered to their view and
invited Mr Clowes, of London, to examine the Press;
Clowes sent his overseer, John William Parker, and
in February, 1829, was appointed Superintendent
of the Press at a salary of £400 a year on the understanding
that, while he himself should execute the
London business which the appointment involved,
the actual superintendence at Cambridge should be
deputed to Parker.</p>

<p>Parker infused new life into the business: he introduced
improved methods of book-keeping, bought
new types and hydraulic presses, installed an apparatus
"for warming the Press buildings by means of
heated air," and in 1832 established a depository
for the sale of Cambridge bibles and prayer-books
at his house in the Strand.</p>

<p>When John Smith retired with a pension in 1836,
Parker was appointed printer in his place, visiting
Cambridge for two days every fortnight; the bible
business continued to expand and in 1838 Parker
could offer fifty-six different editions of the bible
and prayer-book. One bible calls for special comment:
on 10 January, 1835, King William IV wrote
to the Marquess Camden from the Pavilion, Brighton,
suggesting that there should be printed at Cambridge,
as at Oxford, a certain number of bibles for presentation
to sovereigns visiting the country. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Chancellor conveyed the suggestion to the Syndics
who unanimously agreed "that in obedience to His
Majesty's command a quarto Bible with marginal references
be immediately put to press"; 250 copies,
printed on Imperial paper, were to be reserved for
purposes of presentation and one copy was to be
struck off on vellum for the King himself; larger
editions were to be printed on ordinary paper for
general sale and Parker was instructed to order a
special fount of English type.</p>

<p>Reductions in the cost of bibles were also effected
and the Royal Commission of 1850-52 remarked
upon the great reduction of price between 1830 and
1850 "attributable to improved machinery and to
better arrangements in the establishment." One of
the most important of these improvements was the
introduction of steam-power for printing, the Syndics
resolving on 13 June, 1838, "that it appears
expedient to introduce machinery into the Pitt Press."</p>

<p>For many years, however, the Bible Society stoutly
refused to purchase books printed by steam presses.</p>

<p>Apart from the great advances made in the actual
processes of printing during this period, Parker's
work is also of great importance in the development
of Cambridge publishing.</p>

<p>As has been already noted, Parker established a
publishing house in the Strand in 1832 and besides
acting as agent for Cambridge bibles, he included
in his catalogue the greater part of the educational
books printed at the Press. The stock-books kept
at Cambridge show that the bulk of the editions were
delivered to Parker's warehouse in London or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Deighton's in Cambridge and the names of both firms
frequently appear on title-pages. University publications,
together with classical, mathematical, and
theological text-books and treatises, predominate in
the list and the names of such scholars as Blomfield,
Babington, Colenso, Donaldson, Hare, Monk, Paley,
Scholefield, Shilleto, Trench, and Whewell are to be
found amongst the authors.</p>

<p>In 1844 it was proposed to reprint a number of
standard works in theology and general literature "in
order to provide against the loss which the want of
full employment for the Workmen frequently occasions."
It was hoped that by such an undertaking
"the University would not only be enabled to secure
regular occupation for their Printing Establishment,
but would, also, acquire a copyright-interest in certain
important Works which would ultimately prove a
permanent source of income." Out of a long list
three titles were chosen for publication: Stillingfleet's
<i>Conferences and Tracts</i>, Cosin's <i>History of the
Canon</i>, and Knight's <i>Life of Erasmus</i>.</p>

<p class="b1">Not all the books printed, of course, can be regarded
as the publications of the Syndics of the Press.
Some were printed to the order of an author or bookseller
or society (e.g. the Parker Society); others
were private ventures of Parker himself (such as his
series of <i>Popular Literature</i> including <i>Linnaeus and
Botany</i>, <i>Smeeton on Lighthouses</i>, <i>Cuvier and Natural
History</i>, <i>Sir Joseph Banks and the Royal Society</i>); but
others were definitely the property of the university,
as the following minute of the Syndics of 25 May,
1838, shows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">At a meeting of the Syndicate held this day it was
agreed, that the following be the form of an imprint for
the New Edition of Wilson's Illustrations etc of the New
Testament and that the same be adopted as the imprint
in all such editions of books as shall be retained as the
property of the University</p>

<p class="pn35 reduct">Cambridge, printed at the Pitt Press,</p>
<p class="pn30 reduct">by J. W. Parker, Printer to the University</p>

<p class="p1">and again in 1850 it was ordered that it should be
stated on the title-page whether the book was
printed for the author, editor, or publisher.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Parker's career in Cambridge,
there was a distinct decline of business; the extension
of the right of printing bibles to the Scottish printers
in 1842 led to "the forced production of inferior
editions which gradually lowered the prices of those
of better quality produced in England." The Syndics,
in a report to the Senate in 1849, while declaring
the management of the previous 20 years to
have been most satisfactory, found themselves faced
by two alternatives for the future: either a large outlay
upon new types and stereotype plates, or the placing
of the establishment upon a reduced footing&mdash;and the
second course was recommended.</p>

<p>The condition and extent of the Press in 1852 is
summarised in the statement prepared by the Syndics
for the Royal Commission.</p>

<p>There were at this time eighteen Syndics, who
met once a fortnight during term; by a grace of 1752
five (of whom one must be the Vice-Chancellor or
his deputy) constituted a quorum and the average
attendance was 7<sup>9</sup>/<sub>23</sub>.</p>

<p>The printing-office contained frames for 70 compositors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
presses for 56 press men, and 8 printing
machines, requiring about 50 men and boys to work
them; a 10-horse steam-engine, 2 boilers, twining
lathe, forge, and circular saw; one steam power
milling machine, hydraulic and screw hot presses
employing about 100 men and boys in all. The
machinery was claimed to be "good of its kind."
There was provision also for "any number of
Readers, Observers, Warehousemen and Boys, necessary
to carry on, get up, complete, and deliver
the greatest amount of work which could at any
time be done."</p>

<p>The two financial privileges enjoyed by the Press
were the 'drawback' of 1½<i>d</i> a lb. on the paper duty
and the Government annuity of £500, less income
tax<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>The business of the Press was defined as consisting
of the printing of bibles, testaments, and prayer-books;
of printing work for the university and colleges;
of printing books edited for the Syndics; of
book and job printing for the members of the university;
of printing works published by the Parker
and other learned societies; and of "such Book work,
as, subject to the 'Imprimatur' of the Vice-Chancellor,
may be offered by Publishers and other connexions
of the Press."</p>

<p>Finally, the Syndics declared that it did not appear
to them that any change of management could produce
greater profits than were at that time realised.</p>

<p>Parker retired in 1854 and, in spite of the serious
fluctuations in the bible trade, the first half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
nineteenth century must be regarded as a period of
expansion in building, in machinery, and in business.
For the first time the chief servant of the Syndics
was a man with an intimate knowledge of the book
trade, who served the university as publisher as well
as printer. The assumption by the Syndics themselves
of the full responsibilities of a publishing firm was
reserved for the later half of the century.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">THE LATEST AGE</p>

<p class="pn p2">In spite of the statement of the Syndics quoted at
the end of the preceding chapter, the University
Commissioners of 1850-52 reported their opinion
that</p>

<p class="pbqn">it is only by associating printers or publishers in some
species of co-partnership with the University, or by
leasing the Press to them, that any considerable return
can hereafter be expected from the capital which has been
invested in it ... we are satisfied that no Syndicate, however
active and well chosen, can replace the intelligent
and vigilant superintendence of those whose fortune in
life is dependent upon its success.</p>

<p class="p1">Accordingly, on the resignation of Parker, the
Syndicate recommended that the university should
enter into partnership with "Mr George Seeley of
Fleet Street, London, Bookseller, and Mr Charles
John Clay, M.A. of Trinity College and of Bread
Street Hill, London, Printer," and the grace for
the deed of partnership was passed on 3 July, 1854.</p>

<p>The control of the printing thus came into the
hands of Mr Clay, whilst Mr Seeley received the sole
agency for the sale of Cambridge bibles and prayer-books;
Mr Seeley, however, retired two years later
and Mr Clay entered into a fresh agreement with
the university.</p>

<p>The period of Mr Clay's management was one of
great expansion. At the end of his first ten years of
office it was estimated that the Press produced about
four or five times as much as when he first undertook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the management; in 1876, and again in 1886, the
Syndics reported to the Senate that the business had
attained a considerable magnitude and that large additions
had been made to the machinery and plant.</p>

<p>Increase of business naturally demanded increased
accommodation and in 1863 a foundry was built
upon the site of some old cottages in Black Lion
Yard. Eight years later new machine-rooms and
warehouses were built on the site of Diamond Court,
leading out of Silver Street, and a still larger addition
was made in 1877-78, when a three-storied building
was erected in the south-west corner of the quadrangle.
The most recent additions are the extensions
of the warehouse and machine-room on the Silver
Street side and the red brick building (containing the
syndicate room and secretarial offices), which forms
the south side of the quadrangle<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1882 Mr John Clay, son of Mr C. J. Clay, was
admitted into the partnership with the university and
from 1886 to 1904 Mr C. F. Clay was also associated
with it. Mr John Clay became university printer
on his father's retirement in 1895 and held the office
until his death in 1916, when the partnership was
dissolved and the present printer, Mr J. B. Peace,
Fellow of Emmanuel College, was appointed. From
1917 to 1919 the Syndics also employed the services
of Mr Bruce Rogers, whose distinguished work
as a printer is well known on both sides of the
Atlantic. One of the best known figures in the Press
in the later half of the nineteenth century was
that of Alfred Mason. His remarkable personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
dominated the counting-house for a long period
and when he died in 1919 he had been for 65
years in the service of the Press.</p>

<p>The present buildings of the Press include machine-rooms,
containing large quad royal and quad
demy perfectors, revolution presses, and single cylinder
machines; a foundry comprising a stereotyping
department, an electro-moulding room, an electro-battery
room, and two finishing rooms; type storerooms,
composing-rooms, and monotype-rooms; an
art department for lithographic, half-tone, and other
process work; and the warehouse, where the finished
sheets are stored ready to be sent away for binding.
Every month an average of 40 tons of printed
matter leaves the Press to be delivered to London
binders.</p>

<p>Printing is done in a wide variety of languages,
including Hebrew, Arabic, Pali, Coptic, Sanskrit,
Hausa, Syriac and Amharic, and the type catalogue
makes a volume of about 200 pages.</p>

<p class="b1">Perhaps the greatest fame of the Cambridge Press
rests upon its mathematical typography. To glance
at a page, say, of <i>Principia Mathematica</i> is to realise
a little&mdash;but only a little&mdash;of the minute care and skill
required of the compositor, the press-reader, and the
machine-minder in the production of such a book.
It may be permissible here, perhaps, to quote one
recent tribute from the preface to Professor E. W.
Brown's <i>Tables of the Motion of the Moon</i>, printed
in 1918 for the Yale University Press:</p>

<p class="pbq">The reading of the proof has been almost entirely
directed to the detection of errors in the manuscript.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
That this has been possible is due to the remarkable
record of the Cambridge University Press which in setting
up over five hundred quarto pages of numerical
tables has allowed less than a dozen printer's errors to
pass its proof-readers and has, in addition, frequently
queried our own mistakes. Few sheets have required a
second proof and in the actual use of the Tables, as finally
printed, for the calculation of the ephemeris for two years,
no error of any kind has been detected.</p>

<p class="p1">On the retirement of Mr George Seeley in 1856,
Messrs Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co., of Paternoster Row,
were appointed as agents for the Syndics' books<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. This
arrangement, however, does not seem to have been
satisfactory, as the name of a new agent&mdash;George
Cox&mdash;appears in the following year; a further change
was made in 1862 when the firm of Rivingtons became
agents for Cambridge books; finally, when this
agreement came to an end, ten years later, the Syndics
reported to the Senate that "acting on the advice
of Mr Clay" they had decided "not to appoint other
Agents, but to conduct their London business in an
office of their own, under the superintendence of a
paid Manager" and that they had agreed "to take a
Lease of convenient premises in Paternoster Row."</p>

<p>The beginning of the Syndics' career as London
publishers&mdash;in the strict sense of the term&mdash;must
therefore be assigned to the year 1872. At that time
the number of books published by the Syndics&mdash;apart
from bibles and prayer-books&mdash;was very small.
Among them, however, may be noted the first
volume of Mullinger's <i>The University of Cambridge</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
published in 1873, the first instalment of a monumental
work which remained uncompleted at the
author's death in 1917.</p>

<p>In 1874 an important step was taken, the Syndics
deciding to publish a series of editions of Greek,
Latin, French, and German authors designed for use
in schools and especially for candidates for the Local
Examinations. This was the beginning of the Pitt
Press Series, which now includes over 300 volumes,
and such editions as Sidgwick's <i>Virgil</i> and Mr Verity's
<i>Shakespeare</i>&mdash;to name but two out of many&mdash;have
become familiar to many generations of schoolboys.</p>

<p>The Syndics' catalogue for 1875 (a pamphlet
of 16 tiny pages) reflects the beginnings of schoolbook
publishing: it opens with some nine volumes
in the Pitt Press Series; then follow Scrivener's
<i>Paragraph Bible</i>, Scholefield's <i>Greek Testament</i> and
several theological works including Isaac Barrow's
<i>Works</i> in nine volumes; there are five editions of
Greek and Latin authors, among them being Paley
and Sandys's <i>Private Orations of Demosthenes</i> and
Heitland's <i>Cicero pro Murena</i>; mathematics and physics
claim nine books, including Kelvin and Tait's
<i>Elements of Natural Philosophy</i>; history is represented
by Mullinger's first volume, already referred to,
and Mayor's edition of Baker's <i>History of St John's
College</i>; of law books there are three, including
Whewell's edition of <i>Grotius de Iure Belli ac Pacis</i>;
and the list ends with a few catalogues and university
examination papers.</p>

<p>In 1877 the publication of another important series
was begun&mdash;<i>The Cambridge Bible for Schools</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
general editor was Dr J. J. S. Perowne, afterwards
Bishop of Worcester, and the first volume to appear
was Maclear's <i>St Mark</i>.</p>

<p>Originally designed for school use, the series soon
attained a wider public. It was begun before the
publication of the Revised Version and at the very
time when the controversy was raging in Scotland
which resulted in the suspension of Robertson Smith
from his professorship at Aberdeen; when the series
was finally completed by Sir George Adam Smith's
<i>Deuteronomy</i> in 1918, many of the older volumes
had already been replaced or revised. On the death
of Bishop Perowne in 1904 <i>The Times</i> referred to the
series as one which had "done more to spread accurate
Biblical knowledge among English-speaking
people than any book except the Revised Version."</p>

<p>The agreements between the university presses and
the two companies of revisers for the publication of
the Revised Version had been completed, "after
much careful consideration as well as protracted negotiation,"
in 1873.</p>

<p>Three years earlier the New Testament company
had held the first of its 407 meetings in the Jerusalem
Chamber of Westminster Abbey. The company included
the most distinguished theologians of the time&mdash;Hort,
Westcott, Lightfoot, Ellicott, Scrivener,
W. F. Moulton&mdash;and at first an average of only
seventeen verses was revised in the daily session.
Later, however, progress became a little more rapid
and the revision was completed on 11 November,
1880. The Revised New Testament was published
jointly by the university presses in 1881 and the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Testament three years later. The secretary of the
Old Testament company was W. Aldis Wright, for
more than 30 years a Syndic of the Cambridge Press.</p>

<p>By 1890 the catalogue of the Syndics' publications
had grown considerably, not only by additions to
the Pitt Press and other Series, but by the publication
of larger works on literary and scientific subjects, such
as Robertson Smith's <i>Kinship and Marriage in early
Arabia</i>, Willis and Clark's <i>Architectural History of
the University of Cambridge</i>, Maitland's edition of
<i>Bracton's Note Book</i>, and Jebb's <i>Sophocles</i>.</p>

<p>Cayley's <i>Collected Mathematical Papers</i>, in thirteen
volumes, were published between 1889 and
1897, and have since been followed by similar collections
of the mathematical and scientific work of
Kelvin, Rayleigh, Reynolds, Stokes, Sylvester, Tait,
and other scholars. Meanwhile, larger publishing
premises were found to be necessary, and in 1884
the London office was moved to Ave Maria Lane;
with the growth of business these premises similarly
became inadequate and the lease of the present offices
in Fetter Lane was bought by the university in 1904.</p>

<p class="b1">One of the most important of the Syndics' undertakings
towards the end of the last century was
<i>The Cambridge Modern History</i>. Lord Acton had
been elected Regius Professor of Modern History in
1895 and early in 1896 the Syndics approached him
with a view to the compilation of a great English
universal history. In his report of 15 July, 1896
Lord Acton wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq">Universal history is not the sum of all particular histories,
and ought to be contemplated, first, in its distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
essence, as Renaissance, Reformation, Religious
Wars, Absolute Monarchy, Revolution, etc. The several
countries may or may not contribute to feed the main
stream, and the distribution of matter must be made
accordingly. The history of nations that are off the line
must not suffer; it must be told as accurately as if the
whole was divided into annals....</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">and later in a more detailed report:</p>

<p class="pbq">It will be necessary to prescribe exact limits and conditions,
and to explain clearly what we desire to obtain,
and to avoid. We shall avoid the needless utterance of
opinion, and the service of a cause. Contributors will
understand that we are established not under the meridian
of Greenwich, but in longitude 30 West; that our
Waterloo must be one that satisfies French and English,
Germans and Dutch alike.... Ultimate history we cannot
have in this generation; but we can dispose of conventional
history and show the point we have reached on
the road from the one to the other.... If History is often
called the teacher and the guide that regulates public
life, which, to individuals as to societies, is as important
as private, this is the time and the place to prove the
title....</p>

<p class="pbq">The essential elements of the plan I propose for consideration
are these:</p>

<p class="pbq">Division of subjects among many specially qualified
writers.</p>

<p class="pbq">Highest pitch of knowledge without the display.</p>

<p class="pbq">Distinction between the organic unity of general history
and the sum of national histories, as the principle
for selecting and distributing matter.</p>

<p class="pbq">Proportion between historic thought and historic fact.</p>

<p class="pbq">Chart and compass for the coming century.</p>

<p class="p1">Lord Acton, however, did not live to carry out the
work and the editorship was entrusted to Sir A. W.
Ward, Sir G. W. Prothero, and Sir Stanley Leathes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of the volumes of text appeared in 1902
and the whole work was completed by a general index
published in 1912.</p>

<p>This plan of co-operative history has been adopted
by the Syndics in several other branches of learning:
<i>The Cambridge History of English Literature</i> was
completed under the editorship of Sir A. W. Ward
and Mr A. R. Waller in 1916, and other works in
progress are <i>The Cambridge Medieval History</i>, <i>The
Cambridge History of India</i>, <i>The Cambridge History
of British Foreign Policy</i>, and <i>The Cambridge Ancient
History</i>.</p>

<p>Another important undertaking was the publication
of the eleventh edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i> in 1911.</p>

<p class="p2">Short of summarising the forty-five main subject-headings
of the current catalogue, it would be difficult&mdash;as
well as invidious&mdash;to enter into further detail
concerning the modern publications of the Cambridge
University Press. It may suffice to note that
in the years immediately preceding the war the
average annual output of new books, exclusive of
journals, was 150. This figure excludes, of course,
the various editions of Cambridge bibles and prayer-books:
at the present time there are, apart from the
various styles of binding, 26 different editions of the
Authorised, and 19 of the Revised Version; 19
editions of the English, and 6 of the Scottish prayer-book;
of the latter, as of the new Canadian prayer-book,
the Syndics are the sole publishers.</p>

<p>During the war both the printing and publishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
businesses suffered from shortage of personnel, of
metal, and of paper. Two hundred and fifty-two
servants of the Syndics joined His Majesty's forces
and of these forty-one were killed, or died, on
service.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be remarked that the method
of the government of the Press by a body of Syndics
appointed by the Senate of the university has, with
certain important modifications, persisted since 1698.</p>

<p>The constitution of the Syndicate has been more
than once revised&mdash;notably in 1782 and 1855&mdash;and
the length of a Syndic's tenure of office varied from
time to time. The present body consists of the Vice-Chancellor
(<i>ex officio</i>) and fourteen Syndics; the
term of appointment is seven years and two Syndics
retire each year. The first permanent secretary,
Mr R. T. Wright, formerly Fellow of Christ's
College, was appointed in 1892; on his retirement
in 1911 he was succeeded by the present secretary,
Mr A. R. Waller, of Peterhouse.</p>

<p>The Syndics employ a staff of about 280 in Cambridge
and of 110, under the management of Mr
C. F. Clay, at their publishing office in Fetter Lane;
their current catalogue contains the titles of some
2500 books bearing the <i>imprimatur</i> of the university.</p>

<p class="p2">Such, in brief summary, is the measure of the development
of Cambridge printing since John Siberch
set up his press at the sign of the <i>Arma Regia</i> in
1521.</p>
